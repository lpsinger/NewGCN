The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

The online CBC pipeline (gstlal) has made a preliminary
identification of a GW candidate associated with the time
 of Fermi GBM trigger 524666471/170817529 at gps time 1187008884.47
 (Thu Aug 17 12:41:06 GMT 2017) with RA=186.62deg Dec=-48.84deg and an error radius of 17.45deg.

The candidate is consistent with a neutron star binary coalescence with
False Alarm Rate of ~1/10,000 years. 

An offline analysis is ongoing. Any significant updates will be provided
by a new Circular.

The on-board trigger time of Fermi GBM trigger 170817.529 524666471 
at 12:41:06.47 UT is approximately 2 seconds after the single interferometer
LIGO trigger reported in GCN 21505.

Inspection of the real-time data suggests the trigger is consistent with a
weak short GRB, location RA, Dec = 176.8, -39.8 deg (J2000).  The
statistical uncertainty on this location is 11.6 deg 
(radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which we have characterized as a core-plus-tail model, with 90% of
GRBs having a 3.7 deg error and a small tail suffering a larger than 10 deg
systematic error. [Connaughton et al. 2015, ApJS, 216, 32] )

The GBM localization sky map for this event is available at the Fermi Science Support Center 
and shows the uncertainty region including the systematic component:

We investigated serendipitous INTEGRAL observations carried out at the

covering a fraction of the probability of the LIGO-Virgo
localization. The best sensitivity depends on the source location.

We investigated the SPI-ACS light curves between -30 and +30 s from
the trigger time (2017-08-17 12:41:04 UTC, T0) on temporal scales from
0.1 to 100s.

In the SPI-ACS data, we detect a short and relatively weak transient
with S/N of at T0, with an S/N larger than 3. coincident with the GBM
trigger (Connaughton 2017, GCN 21506). Further analysis is ongoing,
and will be reported in the coming circulars.

In addition, we are performing coincident searches with other IceCube data streams, including the high-energy starting events (HESE) and Supernova triggers.  HESE events have typical energies > 60 TeV and start inside the detector volume, leading to a relatively pure event sample with a high fraction of astrophysical neutrinos.  The SN trigger system is sensitive to sudden increases in photomultiplier counts across the detector, which could indicate a burst of MeV neutrinos.  We will submit separate GCN circulars if coincident HESE or SN triggers are found.

DATE:    17/08/17 14:09:25 GMT
FROM:    Reed Clasey Essick at MIT  <ressick@mit.edu>

The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

A binary neutron star candidate was identified in data from the LIGO Hanford detector at gps time 1187008882.4457 (Thu Aug 17 12:41:04 GMT 2017). The signal is clearly visible in time-frequency representations of the gravitational-wave strain in data from H1. The current significance estimate of ~1/10,000 years is based on data from H1 alone. Information about this candidate is available in GraceDb here

https://gracedb.ligo.org/events/view/G298048

The effective distance to this candidate is approximately 58 Mpc and the current localization estimate using gravitational-wave data alone is quite broad because it only makes use of data from H1. We note that this is only an estimate of the effective distance, and the actual luminosity distance to the source is likely larger.

The neutron star coalescence candidate is also clearly visible in data from the LIGO Livingston detector, although there is a coincident noise artifact in the L1 data. To be clear, the binary neutron star candidate is clearly visible in the L1 data on top of the noise artifact. There is no evidence for any noise artifact at H1. Virgo was online at the time, although its data was not used to estimate the candidateÂ’s significance. It is expected to be visible in all detectors once the data has been analyzed.

The gravitational-wave candidate was found in coincidence with Fermi GBM trigger 524666471/170817529, which occurred at gps time 1187008884.47 (Thu Aug 17 12:41:06 GMT 2017). This is approximately 2 seconds after the gravitational-wave candidateÂ’s coalescence time. The Fermi triggerÂ’s localization estimate from Fermi data alone can be found here

The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

In GCN 21509, we reported the identification of a binary neutron star
candidate. We had stated that actual luminosity distance to the source is
likely larger than the estimated effective distance. The effective
distance quoted estimates the *maximum* distance to the source and so the
actual luminosity distance is can be *smaller* than the estimate of the
effective distance.

The BAYESTAR localization generated from H1 data only estimates an actual
luminosity distance of 37 +/- 12 Mpc (a posteriori mean +/- standard
deviation). The distance estimate will likely evolve with further offline
follow-up using data from H1, L1, and V1.

Analyses including data from H1, L1, and V1 are still ongoing and a
sky-map using gravitational-wave data will be made available as quickly as
possible.

The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

We performed a preliminary offline analysis using the PyCBC search (Nitz
et al. arxiv:1705.01513, 2017) of the binary neutron star candidate
G298048 (LSC and Virgo, GCN 21505, 21509, 21510) identified in low-latency
by the gstlal online search (Messick et al. Phys. Rev. D 95, 042001, 2017).

A trigger consistent with a binary neutron star merger is observed at GPS
time 1187008882.443 (2017-08-17 12:41:04 UTC) in both the LIGO Livingston
(L1) and LIGO Hanford (H1) detectors. The trigger is below threshold in
Virgo because of the antenna pattern for Virgo (V1) at the time and
location of this event, but the Virgo instrument contributes to the
localization. The duration of the gravitational-wave signal is
approximately 74 seconds from the searchâ€™s low-frequency cutoff of 27 Hz
to the binary merger.

Investigation of L1 data identified a noise transient from a known class
of instrumental glitches during the inspiral signal. The duration of this
glitch is a small fraction of a second and does not appear to affect the
signal at times away from the glitch. To make an improved preliminary
estimate of the sky position, we re-analyzed the data, removing the L1
noise transient at GPS time 1187008881.389 by multiplying the strain data
with a Tukey window, such that the total duration of the zeroed data is
0.2 s and the total duration of the Tukey window is 1.2 s.

An updated BAYESTAR sky map (Singer et al. 2016, ApJL 829, 15) that uses
data from all three gravitational-wave observatories (H1, L1, and V1) is
available for retrieval from the GraceDB page
(https://gracedb.ligo.org/events/view/G298048): bayestar-HLV.fits.gz. The
centroid (maximum a posteriori) sky location is R.A.=12h57m, Dec.=-17d51m.
The 50% credible region spans about 9 deg2 and the 90% region about 31
deg2. The luminosity distance is 40 +/- 8 Mpc (all-sky a posteriori mean
+/- standard deviation). This is the preferred sky map at this time.

If we assume that the binary is either face on or face off in the plane of
the sky, then we obtain a revised estimate of luminosity distance of 50
+/- 3 Mpc. This assumption does not significantly affect the overall 2D
localization projected onto the sky, but reduces the 3D volume of the
localization (e.g. Pankow et al. 2017, ApJ 834, 154).

We caution that the parameters and significance of this candidate may be
subject to change as data-quality, calibration, and full parameter
estimation studies are ongoing.

We carried out offline analysis of data from Astrosat CZTI in a 100 second window centred on the G298048 trigger time, UT 2017-08-17 12:41:04, to look for any coincident hard X-ray flash. CZTI is a coded aperture mask instrument that has considerable effective area for about 29% of the entire sky. Based on the pointing direction of Astrosat at the time of the GW event and the Bayestar skymap provided by LVC (bayestar.fits.gz,0), the sky visible to CZTI has 12% probability of containing the EM counterpart.

CZTI data were de-trended to remove orbit-wise background variation. We then searched data from the four independent, identical quadrants to look for coincident spikes in the count rates. Searches were undertaken by binning the data in 0.1s, 1s and 10s respectively. Statistical fluctuations in count rates were estimated by using data from 5 previous orbits. We selected confidence levels such that the probability of a false trigger in this 100s window is 10^-4. We do not find any evidence for any hard X-ray transient in this window. We convert our count rates into fluence and flux limits by assuming that the source spectrum has band parameters alpha = -1.0, beta = -2.5, Epeak = 300. The upper limits for source fluence and flux in a 30-200 keV band at different timescales are:

Calculating fluxes assuming band parameters alpha = -1.0, beta = -2.5, Epeak = 300
0.1 s: Effective fluence limit= 6.93e-7 ergs/cm^2; flux= 6.93e-6 ergs/cm^2/s
1.0 s: Effective fluence limit= 1.65e-6 ergs/cm^2; flux= 1.65e-6 ergs/cm^2/s
10.0s: Effective fluence limit= 2.05e-6 ergs/cm^2; flux= 2.05e-7 ergs/cm^2/s

The corresponding all-sky maps are uploaded at https://gracedb.ligo.org/apiweb/events/G298048/files/G298048_CZTI_limits.pdf,0

The total B luminosity of candidate galaxies exceeds by a factor of 4.5 the
total B luminosity we would expect for the error volume from the average B
luminosity of the local universe determined by Kopparapu et al. [2]. Based
on this we assume that in fact the completeness of our galaxy sample within
the volume is 100% in terms of integrated B luminosity.

We have independently found 29 galaxies in the GLADE catalog within 40 +/-
8 Mpc distance limits, residing in the +/- 5 degree neighborhood of the
IceCube neutrino candidate with Fermi GBM trigger 524666471/170817529
reported by Bartos et al. in GCN 21511.

The galaxies found are given in the following table, sorted based on their
absolute B magnitudes (a proxy for BNS formation). All distances are
luminosity distances.

S. N. Zhang (IHEP), report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team:

Insight-HXMT was taking data normally around the GBM trigger time
(T0=2017-08-17 12:41:06.47 UTC) of the short weak bn170817529
(Connaughton 2017, GCN 21506), which is about 2 seconds after the
LIGO trigger of G298048 reported in GCN 21505. This GRB was also
detected by the INTEGRAL/SPI-ACS (Savchenko 2017, GCN 21507).

At T0, both the GBM localization error region and the LHV location area
(reported in GCN 21513) were fully covered by Insight-HXMT
without occultation by the Earth. The incident angle is about 30 deg for
the best GBM location (Ra=190.76 deg, Dec=-39.43 deg), corresponding to
almost the optimum sensitivity of Insight-HXMT to a GRB.

Within T0 +/- 1000 s, no significant excess (SNR > 5) was found
in a search of the Insight-HXMT raw light curves with time scales of
20 ms, 50 ms, 0.2 s and 1 s, respectively. A 3.2 sigma excess is found
2 s before T0, however, consistent with background fluctuations.

With the three typical GRB Band spectral models, integration time of 1 s
and the best GBM localization, the 3-sigma
upper-limits of fluence (0.2 - 5 MeV, incident energy) are reported below:

Band model 1 (alpha=-1.9, beta=-3.7, Ep=70 keV):   1.04e-07 erg cm^-2
Band model 2 (alpha=-1.0, beta=-2.3, Ep=230 keV):  1.44e-07 erg cm^-2
Band model 3 (alpha=0.0, beta=-1.5, Ep=1000 keV):   2.22e-07 erg cm^-2

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (record energy).
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside
of the telescope.

The analysis results presented above are preliminary; more analysis results
with refined LIGO locations will be reported later.
In addition, Insight-HXMT has initiated a ToO observation to the
GBM location region. ToO observation results will be reported as well.

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was funded
jointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS). More information about it could be found at:

(NASA/GSFC), and M. M. Kasliwal (Caltech)

report on behalf of the GROWTH (Global Relay of Observatories Watching
Transients Happen) collaborations

We spatially cross-matched the LIGO/Virgo G298048 trigger (90% containment
volume using bayestar-HLV.fits; LVC GCN 21513) with our Census of the Local
Universe (CLU; Cook et al. in prep) galaxy catalog and found 54 galaxies.
This catalog is a compilation of galaxies with existing redshifts from many
sources (e.g., NED, SDSS, etc) and new galaxies from a 3PI four-filter
narrow-band survey to look for redshifted Halpha emission out to 200 Mpc
with the Palomar Oschin 48-inch telescope. The narrow-band survey is
limited to a declination above -20 degrees, thus all galaxies within the
90% volume come from the compiled CLU catalog with no Halpha overlap.

We list here all 54 galaxies sorted by stellar mass (Mstar) for galaxies
whose location on the sky and distance falls in the 90% volume reported by
the BAYESTAR probability sky map (Singer et al. 2016). We also list the
dust-corrected star formation rates (SFRs) for galaxies with GALEX FUV
detections and a 'nan' for those with no detection.

In addition, we have cross-matched the CLU catalog with the IceCube source
closest to the LIGO localization (GCN #21511) and found 1 galaxy in the
quoted error circle (ra=182.0 deg; dec=-3.2 deg; radius=0.9 deg) and a
distance less than 50 Mpc. This galaxy in presented at the bottom of the
table below and is marked by '**'.

Finally, we have compared CLU to the GLADE results posted in the GCN #21516
and found that all 15 galaxies reported by GLADE are a subset of our 54
galaxies in the 90% LIGO volume. The matched galaxies are marked by '*'

David O. Cook (Caltech), Angela Van Sistine (UW Milwaukee), Leo Singer
(NASA/GSFC), and M. M. Kasliwal (Caltech)

report on behalf of the GROWTH (Global Relay of Observatories Watching
Transients Happen) collaboration

We spatially cross-matched the LIGO/Virgo G298048 trigger with the
assumption of face-on orientation (90% containment volume using
bayestar-HLV-face-on.fits; LVC GCN 21513) with our Census of the Local
Universe (CLU; Cook et al. in prep) galaxy catalog and found 13 galaxies.
This catalog is a compilation of galaxies with existing redshifts from many
sources (e.g., NED, SDSS, etc) and new galaxies from a 3PI four-filter
narrow-band survey to look for redshifted Halpha emission out to 200 Mpc
with the Palomar Oschin 48-inch telescope. The narrow-band survey is
limited to a declination above -20 degrees, thus all galaxies within the
90% volume come from the compiled CLU catalog with no Halpha overlap.

We list here all 13 galaxies sorted by stellar mass (Mstar) for galaxies
whose location on the sky and distance falls in the 90% volume reported by
the BAYESTAR probability sky map (Singer et al. 2016). We also list the
dust-corrected star formation rates (SFRs) for galaxies with GALEX FUV
detections and a 'nan' for those with no detection.

Of the 13 galaxies, 4 galaxies are not in the list of 54 galaxies reported
in GCN #21519 without the face-on assumption. The new galaxies are marked
with a â€˜*â€™.

Pradier (IPHC/Universite de Strasbourg) report on behalf of the ANTARES Collaboration:

Using on-line data from the ANTARES detector, we have performed a follow-up analysis of the recently reported LIGO/Virgo G298048 event
using the updated Bayestar-HLV probability map at event time. The ANTARES visibility at the time of the alert together with the 90% contour 
of the probability map are shown in: https://www.cppm.in2p3.fr/~dornic/events/G298048/170817_visi2.png <https://www.cppm.in2p3.fr/~dornic/events/G298048/170817_visi2.png> (gwantares/GW@ANT31). The 90% 
contour of the probability map is outside of the ANTARES field-of-view at the alert time.

No up-going muon neutrino candidate events were recorded in the ANTARES sky during a +/- 500s time-window centered on the G298048 event
time. The expected number of atmospheric background events in the region visible by ANTARES is ~1.1e-2 in the +/- 500s time window. An
extended search during +/- 1 hour gives no up-going neutrino coincidence.

An estimate of the upper limit on the associated neutrino fluence will be sent in a subsequent circular.

ANTARES, being installed in the Mediterranean Deep Sea, is the largest neutrino detector in the Northern Hemisphere.  It is primarily
sensitive to astrophysical neutrinos in the TeV-PeV energy range.  At 10 TeV, the median angular resolution for muon neutrinos is below 0.5 degrees.  
In the range 1-100 TeV, ANTARES has the best sensitivity to a large fraction of the Southern sky.

report on behalf of the Swift team:

We report the search results in the BAT data within T0 +/- 100 s of the
LVC event G298048 (LIGO/VIRGO Collaboration GCN Circ. 21513), 
where T0 is the LVC trigger time (2017-08-17T12:41:04.445 UTC).

The center of the BAT FOV at T0 is
RA = 36.075 deg,
DEC = -52.287 deg,
ROLL = 108.515 deg.
The BAT Field of View (>10% partial coding) covers 0.0% of the integrated
LVC localization probability. That is, there is no overlap between the BAT
field of view and the LVC probability region at T0.

Within T0 +/- 100 s, no significant detections (signal-to-noise ratio >~ 5 sigma) 
are found in the BAT raw light curves with time bins of 64 ms, 1 s, and 1.6 s, 
respectively. Assuming an on-axis (100% coded) short GRB with a typical spectrum in 
the BAT energy range (i.e., a simple power-law model with a power-law index of -1.32, 
Lien & Sakamoto et al. 2016), the 5-sigma upper limit in the 1-s binned light curve 
corresponds to a flux upper limit (15-350 keV) of ~ 7.82 x 10^-8 erg/s/cm^2.

BAT retains decreased, but significant, sensitivity to rate increases for
gamma-ray events outside of its FOV. About 0.15% of the integrated LVC
localization probability was outside of the BAT FOV but above the Earth's limb 
from Swift's location, and the corresponding flux upper limits for this region 
are within roughly an order of magnitude of those within the FOV.

In response to the LIGO/Virgo GW event G298048 at T0 = 2017-08-17
12:41:04.446 UTC, a preliminary analysis of the AGILE MiniCALorimeter (MCAL)
data found no event candidates within a time interval covering approximately
-/+ 10 sec from the LIGO T0.

Due to Earth occultation the MCAL field of view did not cover the new
revised HLV G298048 90% localization region (GCN #21513).

At T0 MCAL exposed about 10% of the Fermi-GBM 3-sigma localization region
(GCN #21506, T0_GBM=2017-08-17T12:41:06.47 UTC) . The closest in time MCAL
triggered data acquisition occurred about 7 sec after the Fermi-GBM trigger,
resulting in typical values of the fluence 3-sigma UL ranging from 5.2 e^-7
erg cm^-2 to 6.3 e^-7 erg cm^-2 (assuming a power law spectral model with
photon index1.4 and 1 sec integration time).

The AGILE-MCAL detector is a CsI detector with a 4-pi FoV, working in the
range 0.4 - 100 MeV. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.

Preliminary values of 3-sigma upper limits (UL) obtained within the
accessible Fermi-GBM 3-sigma localization region are reported below:

from 1.4e-06 to 2.2e-06 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for integration time of 2s

from 3.2e-08 to 8.8e-08 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for integration time of 100s

The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

Parameter estimation has been performed using LALInference (Veitch et
al., PRD 91, 042003) and a revised sky map, preliminary-LALInference.fits.gz, is
available for retrieval from the GraceDB event page:
https://gracedb.ligo.org/events/G298048


We caution that this is a preliminary map from the offline parameter 
estimation. This analysis uses data from the LIGO Hanford, LIGO Livingston,
and Virgo detectors with the noise transient in Livingston
removed from the data prior to the analysis, as described in GCN 21513. 
Posterior chains in the parameter estimation may not yet have fully converged.

The 50% and 90% credible regions span about 8.6 and 33.6 square
degrees, respectively, which are somewhat larger than the initial
BAYESTAR sky map. The centroid (maximum a posteriori) sky 
location is R.A.=13h09m, Dec.=-25d37m.

We will continue to refine the sky map as offline parameter estimation
improves and as we apply additional methods of cleaning the data.

The GBM trigger (Connaughton et al., LVC GCN 21506), which we determine to
be a short GRB, occurred about 2 minutes before Fermi entered the South
Atlantic Anomaly. To estimate the False Alarm Rate (FAR) of a chance
coincident short GRB without using spatial information, we estimate the
rate of short GRBs (defined as t90 <= 2 s) triggered by GBM.  GBM has a
total of 351 triggered short GRBs over an estimated triggering livetime of
3.23e8 s. This results in a FAR of one per 10.7 days. A simple estimate of
the False Alarm Probability using only the temporal information of the two
signals is 2.2e-6 (~4.5 sigma).

The initial public report of the GRB (von Kienlin et al., GCN 21520)
contained the spectral information using the maximum of the GBM
localization posterior. Using the maximum of the updated LIGO/Virgo
localization posterior (LVC, LVC GCN 21513), which is consistent with the
GBM localization, we report the updated preliminary spectral information.

The estimated GRB duration is ~ 2 s and is best fit by a power-law function
with an exponential high-energy cutoff from T0-0.75 to T0+1.25 s.  The
power-law index is -0.88 +/- 0.44 and the cutoff energy, parametrized as
Epeak, is 128.0 +/- 48.7 keV. The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time
interval is (2.2 +/- 0.5)e-7 erg/cm^2, which we estimate to be near the
58th percentile of GBM-triggered short GRB fluences. The 64 ms peak photon
flux estimated starting at T0 is 3.6 +/- 1.1 ph/s/cm^2 (10-1000 keV).  The
corresponding spectrum over this peak flux interval is fit by an
exponential high-energy power law with index = -0.29 +/- 1.01 and Epeak =
124.2 +/- 52.6 keV.  The event peak energy flux (10-1000 keV) is (7.3 +/-
2.4)e-7 erg/s/cm^2.

Using this spectral information and the distance information provided by
the LVC (40 +/- 8 Mpc) we estimate that the isotropic energy release in
gamma-rays, Eiso ~ 4.3e46 erg in the 1 keV-10 MeV energy range and the
isotropic peak luminosity, Liso ~1.4e47 erg/s.

These results are preliminary and may be updated with further analysis.

report on behalf of the One-Meter Two-Hemisphere (1M2H) collaboration:

On 2017 Aug 18 UT in the process of observing several galaxies coincident
with the highest-likelihood localization region for the LIGO/Virgo G298048
trigger (LVC GCNs 21509, 21513) with the 1-m Swope telescope at Las
Campanas Observatory, we detect a source 5.3¿ E and 8.8¿ N of NGC 4993, an
S0 galaxy in the NGC 4993 / ESO 508-G018 group at a distance of ~40 Mpc
(Tully-Fisher distance to the group; Freedman et al., ApJ, 553, 47, 2001).
The object is:

SSS17a  13:09:48.089  -23:22:53.35

and had a brightness of i = 16.0 mag.

We have checked the minor planet center and previous SN discoveries, and
have found no cross-matches.  This source could possibly be optical
emission associated with the LIGO/Virgo G298048 trigger.

Spectroscopic observations are under way.  Additional photometry has been
obtained and is being analyzed. Additional observations are encouraged.

On behalf of the larger DESGW+community team:

We have imaged the BAYESTAR localization map of LIGO/Virgo G298048 (GCN 21513) 
using DECam on the CTIO 4m in both i and z band.  Visual inspection of 
unprocessed DECam images reveals a new source not present in Pan-STARRS 3Pi 
images north and east of NGC 4993 (d~40 Mpc, from NED), consistent with the 
source found by Coulter et al. (LVC GCN 21529).  Analysis and further 
observations are ongoing.

The observations were carried out simultaneously in the g, r, i, z and H bands starting on 2017 Aug 18 at 23:11:29 UT. 

In the optical/NIR images of the galaxy NGC 4993, obtained starting from 01:29:28 UT at airmass~3, we clearly detect in all bands the optical source reported by Coulter et al. (LVC GCN 21529), Allam et al. (LVC GCN 21530) and Yang et al. (LVC GCN 21531)

Further analysis and observations are ongoing.

 P. S. Cowperthwaite (Harvard),  R. J. Foley (UCSC), E. Berger (Harvard),

We investigate ASAS-SN public data at the position of the transient source
SSS17a (RA = 13:09:48.09 DECL. = -23:22:53.35, Coulter et al. 2017 GCN
21529). This source is also seen in DECam observations (Chornock et al. GCN
21530) and DLT data (Yang et al. GCN 21531).

We search the last 100 days of available data, finding no strong evidence
for variability at this position. The most recent observation is UT =
2017-08-14.9933703 (HJD = 2457980.49073), approximately 2 days before the
GW trigger.

The data can be found here:

https://asas-sn.osu.edu/public/light_curve/ede9a693-78be-4049-85a0-7de11bc61c3a

The photometry is generated by placing an aperture at the indicated
coordinates, and therefore includes light from the host galaxy.

The light curve is flat with a mean magnitude of 13.45 mag with a scatter
of 0.05 mag. This indicates that the transient is most likely a young
source.

This circular makes use of ASAS-SN public data obtained from
https://asas-sn.osu.edu/ (Shappee, B. J., Prieto, J. L., Grupe, D.,
et al. 2014, ApJ, 788, 48; Kochanek, C. S., Shappee, B. J., Stanek, K.

D. Kocevski (NASA/MSFC), N. Omodei (Stanford), S. Buson (NASA/GSFC), F. Longo (University and INFN, Trieste), J. Racusin (NASA/GSFC), and G. Vianello (Stanford) report on behalf of the Fermi-LAT team:   

We searched data collected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) for possible high-energy (E > 100 MeV) gamma-ray emission in spatial/temporal coincidence with the LIGO/Virgo trigger G298048 .   

The Fermi gamma-ray space telescope was entering the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) at the time of the trigger (T0 = 2017-08-17 12:41:4.444 , 524666469.444 MET). During SAA passages the LAT does not collect data due to the high charged particle background in this region. We note that the SAA boundary employed by the LAT encompasses a larger area than the boundaries used by the the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM), resulting in different times at which the two instruments do not collect data. The LAT resumed data taking upon exiting the SAA at roughly T0 +1153 s,  At that time 100% of the BAYESTAR sky map using data from all three gravitational-wave observatories (H1, L1, and V1) (GCN 21513) was within the LAT field of view (FOV).   

We performed a search for a transient counterpart within the 90% contour of the LIGO/Virgo sky map in the time window from T0 + 1153s to T0 + 2027s, corresponding to the times when the region entered and exited the LAT FOV, and no significant new sources were found. We also performed a search which adapted the time interval of the analysis to the exposure of each region of the sky. No significant candidate counterpart was detected. 

The Fermi-LAT point of contact for this event is Daniel Kocevski (daniel.kocevski@nasa.gov)    

The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.

(NASA/GSFC), and M. M. Kasliwal (Caltech)

report on behalf of the GROWTH (Global Relay of Observatories Watching
Transients Happen) collaboration

We spatially cross-matched the LIGO/Virgo G298048 trigger with no
assumption on orientation (90% containment volume using
preliminary-LALInference.fits; LVC GCN 21527) with our Census of the Local
Universe (CLU; Cook et al. in prep) galaxy catalog and found 60 galaxies.
This catalog is a compilation of galaxies with existing redshifts from many
sources (e.g., NED, SDSS, etc) and new galaxies from a 3PI four-filter
narrow-band survey to look for redshifted Halpha emission out to 200 Mpc
with the Palomar Oschin 48-inch telescope. The narrow-band survey is
limited to a declination above -20 degrees, thus all galaxies within the
90% volume come from the compiled CLU catalog with no Halpha overlap.

We list here all 60 galaxies sorted by stellar mass (Mstar) for galaxies
whose location on the sky and distance falls in the 90% volume reported by
the BAYESTAR probability sky map (Singer et al. 2016). We also list the
dust-corrected star formation rates (SFRs) for galaxies with GALEX FUV
detections and a 'nan' for those with no detection.

In addition, we have compared these galaxies to those reported in our
original crossmatch (GCN #21519) and have found that 20 of these are new
galaxies. The new galaxies are marked by '*'.

We note that the host galaxy of the reported optical transient (GCNs
#21529, #21530, #21531) is NGC 4993. This galaxy was #3 on our original
list ranked by stellar mass (GCN #21519) and is #4 on the list below.

* Galaxies not reported in the original CLU-LIGO crossmatch (GCN
#21519)

The SFRs are derived from GALEX all sky kron FUV magnitudes via the
prescription of Murphy et al. (2011) and have been corrected for internal
dust extinction using a combination of GALEX FUV and 22um ALLWISE fluxes
(Hao et al. 2011). The quoted stellar masses are derived from 3.4um ALLWISE
fluxes and a mass-to-light ratio of 0.5 (McGaugh & Schombert et al. 2015).

report:

The position of the potential optical counterpart (Coulter et al., LVC GCN
21529, Allam et al. LVC GCN 21530, Yang et al. LVC GCN 21531, Melandri et
al. LVC GCN 21532) to the LIGO/Virgo G298048 trigger (LVC GCNs 21509,
21513) was imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope on 2017 April 28 UT with
ACS in the F606W filter (Program ID: 14840; PI Bellini; 696 sec exposure
time) as part of the "Schedule Gap Pilot Program."  Examining the image  we
do not detect any sources within 2.2" of the nominal position to a 5-sigma
limiting magnitude of ~25.9 mag, corresponding to M_V ~ -7.2 mag at a
distance of 36 Mpc.

We also note that the possible host galaxy, NGC 4993, has obvious dust
lanes near its nucleus and extending out ~5" from the nucleus
(corresponding to ~1 kpc at 36 Mpc).

We report the observation of 20 galaxies within the LVC error region for the GW trigger G298048 using the LIGO bayestar HLV localization map. We selected galaxies from the GWGC catalogue within 99.0% of the trigger error region, within a distance of 40.0 Mpc, brighter than -17.5 mag and at a Declination < 20 degree.
Those selected galaxies have been observed using the Prompt 5 telescope and they are part of the ongoing DLT40 search. The DLT40 search limit magnitude, for those galaxies is 19.2 (open filter scaled to r band).

On behalf of the DESGW+community team:

We report preliminary optical i- and z-band photometry from DECam imaging of
the possible optical counterpart to G298048 first identified in Coulter et
al. (LVC GCN 21529),  and further reported on by Allam et al. (LVC GCN
21530), Valenti et al. (LVC GCN 21531), Melandri et al. (LVC GCN 21532) and
Arcavi et al. (GCN 21538). Observations were obtained on 2017-08-18 at
00:04 UTC.

We find preliminary PSF magnitudes of

i = 17.5 +/- 0.1 mag
z = 17.5 +/- 0.1 mag

This suggests an i-z color of 0 mag, which is consistent with the expected
colors of a Short GRB afterglow, but not for lanthanide dominated kilonova
emission (e.g., Barnes & Kasen 2013, Barnes et al. 2016, Wollaeger et al.
2017).

These magnitudes are determined from difference PSF photometry of DECam
images relative to Pan-STARRs 3pi catalogs.

Further analysis is ongoing.

We investigate SkyMapper Transient Survey data at the position of the optical source reported by Coulter et al. (LVC GCN 21529), Allam et al. (LVC GCN 21530), Yang et al. (LVC GCN 21531), Melandri et al. (LVC GCN 21532). We obtained subtraction photometry for the coordinates RA = 13:09:48.09 DECL. = -23:22:53.35 finding no evidence of variability between 2015-05-08 and 2017-07-22. The last observations of the SkyMapper Transient Survey of this field was on 2017-07-22 (limiting magnitude 19.6 in i) and 2017-07-21  (limiting magnitude 20.5 magnitude in r, 19.16 in i). 

The data and thumbnails can be found here:

The photometry is generated by placing an aperture at the indicated coordinates in difference images.

Further observations are ongoing.

G298048 trigger using the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) worldwide telescope
network.

We target galaxies from the GLADE catalog and prioritize them by their
position in the LIGO/Virgo localization region, their mass (estimated from
their absolute B-band magnitude), and inversely by their distance.

Between 2017-08-17 17:04 and 18:42 UT we observed the following galaxies
using the two LCO 1-meter telescopes at the South African Astronomical
Observatory in the following filters with a 300s exposure per filter:

All r-band images were visually inspected for new sources compared to
archival DSS images. No obvious ones were found.
The above galaxies were chosen to also lie close to the FERMI localization
region. Following the revised LIGO/Virgo localization from Singer et al.

N. R. Tanvir (U. Leicester), A. J. Levan (U. Warwick) report on behalf of the VINROUGE collaboration.

We observed the region around the location of the proposed optical 
counterpart of LIGO/Virgo G298048 (Coulter et al. LVC GCN 21529) using 
the VIRCAM camera on the wide-field ESO VISTA telescope.  
The source is clearly detected with a provisional magnitude 
J(AB)=17.5+/-0.1 at Aug-18 00:10 UT.  We note that this is consistent with 
colours that are flat in Fnu, as noted by Nicholl et al. (LVC GCN 21541)
from DECam data taken at a similar epoch.
Further analysis is ongoing.

We thank the staff at Paranal for their excellent support of these
observations.

K.D. Alexander, W. Fong, and E. Berger report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

We observed the position of the optical candidate reported by Coulter et
al. (LVC GCN 21529) and others (Allam et al. LVC GCN 21530, Valenti et al.
LVC GCN 21531, Melandri et al. LVC GCN 21532, and Arcavi et al. GCN 21538)
with the Very Large Array beginning at 2017 August 18 02:09:00 UT (13.5 h
after the Fermi trigger time). At a mean frequency of 9.77 GHz, we detect a
source with a preliminary flux density of ~0.3 mJy at the position:

RA (J2000) =13:09:47.850
dec (J2000) =-23:23:01.29

with an error of 1.3" in each coordinate. This is consistent with the
optical position reported by Coulter et al. Further observations are
planned.

We thank the VLA staff for rapidly executing these observations.

On 2017 Aug 18.02 UT, we obtained an optical spectrum of the transient source SSS17a (RA = 13:09:48.09 DECL. = -23:22:53.35, Coulter et al. 2017; GCN 21529) possibly associated with LIGO/Virgo G298048, with the LDSS-3 spectrograph on the 6.5m Magellan-Clay telescope at Las Campanas Observatory.  The resulting spectrum shows a blue and featureless continuum between 4000 and 10,000 Angstroms, consistent with a power-law.

Additional observations are encouraged.

K.D. Alexander (Harvard), W. Fong (Northwestern), and E. Berger (Harvard)
report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have completed a more thorough analysis of the VLA observations
previously reported by Alexander et al. (LVC GCN 21529), in which we
detected radio emission near the position of the candidate optical
counterpart to LIGO/Virgo G298048. We now believe that the previously
reported position underestimated the coordinate uncertainties created by
the highly elongated beam shape (~9" by 1.5") due to the low elevation of
the target. We note that the center of the observed VLA position is
actually closer to the position of the candidate host galaxy, NGC 4993,
than to the position of the optical transient reported by Coulter et al.
(LVC GCN 21529), and may contain an unknown amount of host contribution.

At this time we cannot state with confidence whether this radio emission
originates from the galaxy or the optical transient. Analysis is ongoing
and further observations are planned.

Tominaga, N. (Konan Univ.), Motohara, K., Ohsawa, R., Morokuma, T. 
(Univ. of Tokyo), Kawai, N. (Tokyo Tech) on behalf of the J-GEM 
collaboration 

We performed follow-up observations for the gravitational event 
G298048 (GCN 21505; 21509; 21513) with Hyper Suprime-Cam attached 
to the Subaru telescope on August 18 2017 UT. The observations 
started at 5:20 UT and were continued until 6:00 UT. We used HSC-z 
band filter. The sky area of about 25 deg2 centered at (alpha, 
delta) = (-162.8 deg, -25 deg) was covered with 24 HSC pointings. 
This area includes the candidate of optical counterpart (SSS17a) 
in the galaxy NGC 4993 reported by Coulter et al. (GCN 21529) and 
covers 60% of the probability area of the LALInference skymap 
(GCN 21527). Typical exposure time was 30 seconds. 

SSS17a is clearly seen in our z-band images. We made rough 
photometry of this object and obtained z-band magnitude of ~17 
(AB). Further analysis is on going. 

The sky fields and galaxies observed by this survey are listed

on behalf of the Swift team:

Swift has performed ToO observations of  the proposed optical
counterpart of LIGO/Virgo G298048 (Coulter et al. LVC GCN 21529).
We obtained 2 ks of data from 53.8 to 55.8 ks after the LVC trigger.

No X-ray source is detected at the location of the transient reported by 
Coulter et al. The 3-sigma upper limit at this location is 4.5e-3 
ct/sec. For a typical GRB spectrum this corresponds to 1.8e-13 
erg/cm^2/s (0.3-10 keV). Assuming a distance of 40 Mpc this corresponds 
to a 0.3-10 keV luminosity of 3.5e40 erg/s.

D'Avanzo et al (2014, MNRAS, 442, 2342) compiled the observed 2-10 keV 
luminosity at 11 hours post-trigger for a complete sample of 
Swift-detected short GRBs; these were typically of order 1e41-1e43 
erg/s. Our measurement corresponds to a 2-10 keV luminosity of 2.3e40 
erg/s, ~an order of magnitude fainter than all of the other sGRBs in 
that paper apart from GRB 080905. However those authors also showed a 
correlation between Eiso and X-ray afterglow luminosity, so given the 
low Eiso (Goldstein et al., LVC Circ. 21528) this may not be surprising.

The afterglow is detected in the Swift-UVOT data. Analysis is 
complicated by the nearby presence the galaxy NGC4993, but we obtain the 
following magnitudes:

Filter  Magnitude     Start time     Stop time
u      16.9 ± 0.06    T0+53.8 ks     T0+54.5 ks
w1     17.74 ± 0.09   T0+55.0 ks     T0+55.3 ks
m2     19.26 ± 0.18   T0+54.5 ks     T0+55.0 ks
w2     19.12 ± 0.17   T0+55.3 ks     T0+55.8 ks


We note that it is very unusual for an optical counterpart to be found 
but no X-ray counterpart, especially given the brightness of the optical 
counterpart. Therefore, if this object is a GRB afterglow, it is 
atypical compared to the sample of Swift-BAT triggered objects observed 
to date. We suggest therefore that the object may be a blue (i.e. 
lanthanide-free) kilonova.

On 2017 Aug 18.01 UT we obtained g-band images of the transient source
SSS17a (RA = 13:09:48.09 DECL. = -23:22:53.35, Coulter et al. 2017; GCN
21529) possibly associated with LIGO/Virgo G298048, with LDSS-3 on the 6.5m
Magellan-Clay telescope at Las Campanas Observatory.  We measure a
provisional magnitude of g = 17.2 +/- 0.1, consistent with the blue color
reported spectroscopically by Drout et al. 2017 (GCN 21547) and at redder
wavelengths by Nicholl et al. 2017 (GCN 21541).  We also note a tentative
detection of a slight decrease in brightness over three exposures spanning
12 minutes.  Further analysis is ongoing.

collaboration:

On 2017 Aug 18.06 UT, we obtained near-infrared observations with the
FLAMINGOS-2 instrument on Gemini-South of the field of the optical
transient candidate SSS17a (Coulter et al., GCN 21529; Allam et al., GCN
21530; Yang et al., GCN 21531, Melandri et al., GCN 21532; etc.) that was
reported in connection with the LIGO/Virgo candidate G298048 (LVC, GCNs
21509, 21510, 21513).

We obtained 230 s of imaging in K_s band. A source is clearly visible at a
position that is consistent with the previously reported optical
transient. Calibrating to the 2MASS Point Source Catalog, we measure a
K_s-band magnitude of 16.9 +/- 0.2 (Vega).

In addition to the optical transient, we also obtained K_s band imaging of
two of the 13 galaxies in the Census of the Local Universe (CLU)
cross-match with the BAYESTAR face-on localization (Cook et al., GCN
21521). We plan to observe the remaining galaxies over the coming nights.

We thank Gemini Observatory for rapidly reviewing and awarding us
directors' discretionary time under which these observations were taken.
We thank H. Kim and K. Silva, and the rest of the Gemini-South staff, for
promptly executing these observations.

We report Pan-STARRS imaging observations of the the skymap of
G298048. A set of six images were taken, in twilight and at low
airmass. We had planned to tile the northern part of the skymap, but
after the discovery of the transient SSS17a/DLT17ck in GCN 21529
(Coulter et al) and 21531 (Valenti et al.) we immediately switched to
cover the NGC4993 in 2x30s in each of Pan-STARRS i, z, y, ensuring the
postion of the transient object was on a good, clean CCD cell.

Difference images were produced by subtracting the Pan-STARRS1 3Pi
reference image from these separate 30s exposures (Chambers et
al. arXiv:1612.05560, and available at http://panstarrs.stsci.edu).

We recover the transient as Pan-STARRS object PS17gl at coordinates

There is no evidence, within the uncertainties for fading between the
exposures. If the Swope 1m photometry point of i=16 (Coulter et al.)
is correct then this would imply substantial fading. But this needs
checked, since DLT17ck was reported at R=17.3, is more consistent with 
the colours we measure :

i - z = -0.02 +/- 0.02
z - y = -0.26 +/- 0.18 

This is consistent with the DECam photometry by Nicholl et
al. (GCN21541) and that within the uncertainties, the colours are
consistent with 0, and being flat in Fnu as reported by the J-band
detection of Tanvir & Levan (GCN21544). Further observations are
planned with the same filter setup as long as the target is
observable, or firmly ruled out as a counterpart to G298048.

Visual inspection of the images shows no new source that could be associated with G298048. We note that all four locations are outside the revised HLV localisation region (LIGO Scientific Collaboration et al, GCN 21513).

We examined the MAXI/GSC all-sky X-ray images (2-20 keV) obtained
in the orbits following LIGO/Virgo trigger G298048 and the Fermi GBM trigger
524666471/170817.529 at 2017-08-17 12:41:06.47 UTC (GCN 21506).

At the trigger time of Fermi GBM, the high-voltage of MAXI/GSC was off,
and it was turned on at T0+173 sec.
The center of the Fermi GBM localization was located near the pole of
ISS orbital rotation, where the MAXI/GSC cannot cover the field.
The field of candidate optical counterpart (GCN 21529) was marginally
covered by MAXI and  was scanned at 12:23 UT (18 min before the trigger),
but the OT position was obscured by an ISS structure.

The OT candidate position was difficult to cover with MAXI/GSC due to
unfavorable orientation of the orbital plane of the ISS, and therefore
it was not observed for the following 8 orbits.
The first scan by MAXI/GSC was started at 08-18 02:19 UTC (818 min
after the LIGO trigger).
We did not detect a significant source at this position with a 3-sigma
upper limit of
54 mCrab.  This limit is higher than the typical value because of high
particle background flux.

For the remaining area of the G298048 preliminary-LALInference skymap,
we obtained a typical 1(3)-sigma upper limit of
11(33) mCrab in the orbit following the trigger.

SUBJECT: LIGO/Virgo G298048: Likelihood of SSS17a Being an Unrelated Extragalactic Transient in NGC 4993
DATE:    17/08/18 12:15:23 GMT
FROM:    Ryan Foley at UCSC  <foley@ucsc.edu>

R. J. Foley (UC Santa Cruz) reports

In the interest of focusing follow-up observing resources, we perform a quick assessment of how â€œuniqueâ€ the potential EM counterpart to the LIGO/Virgo G298048 trigger (LVC GCNs 21509, 21513), SSS17a (Coulter et al., LVC GCN 21529), is in the context of other extragalactic astrophysical transients.

The optical spectrum (Drout et al., LVC GCN 21547) and colors (Nicholl et al., LVC GCN 21541; Chambers et al., LVC GCN 21553) are inconsistent with a Type Ia supernova at any epoch.  Its nominal host galaxy, NGC 4993, is an S0 galaxy, which typically have little star formation (although there are dust lanes near the SN position; Foley et al., LVC GCN 21536).  If at the distance of its nominal host galaxy, NGC 4993, correcting for only Milky Way extinction, SSS17a had a peak luminosity of M_g ~ -16.0 mag (e.g., Simon et al., LVC GCN 21551), which is much more luminous than novae, much less luminous than SNe Ia near peak, and similar to some core-collapse SNe near peak.  The lack of a strong source in recent imaging (Cowperthwaite et al., LVC GCN 21533) indicates that SSS17a is <~ 2 days old.  At the very least, there was no source to deep limits from Hubble images ~4 months ago (Foley et al., LVC GCN 21536).  These data provide strongly constraining information on the nature of SSS17a.

Approximately 7.3% of all supernovae in S0 galaxies are core-collapse galaxies (Foley & Mandell, 2013, ApJ, 778, 167).  Using the luminosity of NGC 4993 and the formulae of Li et al. (2011, MNRAS, 412, 1473), we find that ~17% of all supernovae in S0 galaxies with a similar luminosity to that of NGC 4993 are core-collapse SNe.

Using the Li et al. local volumetric core-collapse rate, we expect ~0.1 core-collapse SN per year in the 90% LIGO localization volume.  A core-collapse SN exploding within 2 days of the LIGO trigger and within this volume has a probability of roughly 5 x 10^-5.  Including all SNe, this number only increases to 8 x 10^-5.  The probability of a core-collapse SN exploding since the Hubble images were obtained inside the LIGO volume is ~0.003.  We note that these calculations do not account for possible overdensities, and NGC 4993 is a member of a relatively massive group of galaxies.

Finally, examining the core-collapse luminosity functions of Li et al. (2011, MNRAS, 412, 1441), ~50% of Type Ib/c supernovae and ~65% of Type II supernovae in S0-Sbc galaxies have peak absolute magnitudes greater than -16.0 mag.  That is, roughly half of all core-collapse SNe in S0-Sbc galaxies never reach the reported magnitude of SSS17a.

Combined, we estimate that the likelihood of SSS17a being an unrelated core-collapse SN in NGC 4993 to be ~5 x 10^-6.  Excluding the strongest constraints related to possible recent non-detections, the likelihood of SSS17a being an unrelated core-collapse SN in NGC 4993 is ~3 x 10^-4.

We conclude that SSS17a is a rare event, and warrants significant additional follow-up observations.

A. Klotz (IRAP CNRS/UPS), R. Laugier, M. Boer, K. Noysena (ARTEMIS 
CNRS/UCA/OCA) report on behalf of the TZAC collaboration

We have observed the initial error box with the TRE (TAROT-Reunion) 
Telescope located at Les Makes Observatory, La RÃ©union Island, France. 
Each image (no filter)  lasts for 120s and covers a field of 4.2 x 4.2 
deg2, with a magnitude limit of 17.0. Unfortunately the position of the 
candidate afterglow reported by Coulter et al. (LVC GCN 21529) was not 
in the position observable at that time given the automated generation 
of the fields, the mixed weather conditions, and the position of the GW 
candidate transient in the sky.

We list below the log of the observations. Images are under analysis.

K. Bannister (CSIRO), C. Lynch (University of Sydney), D. Kaplan (UWM),
T. Murphy (University of Sydney), D. Dobie (University of Sydney) on behalf
of the VAST collaboration.

We observed 54 candidate host galaxies in the LIGO/Virgo
G298048 localisation volume with the Australia Telescope Compact Array
(LVC GCN 21513, sky map; LVC GCN 21519, 54 nearby galaxies).
Observations started at 2017-08-18 01:00 UT and ended at
2017-08-18 09:14:15 UT with approximately 1-2 minutes of on-source
time for each target.

We detect an unresolved radio source coincident with NGC 4993. The
best-measured position was at 8.5 GHz:

RA = 13:09:47.7
Dec = -23:22:59.1

(J2000) with positional errors of 1â€ in RA and 4â€ in declination.

This position is in agreement with the VLA detection of a radio source
(Alexander et al. LVC GCN 21548) within the stated errors of each observation.

We report preliminary flux densities of:

~0.6 mJy at 8.5 GHz
~0.5 mJy at 10.5 GHz
~0.4 mJy at 16.7 GHz
~0.4 mJy at 21.2 GHz

We find no evidence for any radio emission at the position of the optical
transient (Coulter et al. LVC GCN 21529).

Analysis of the full dataset is underway. Subsequent epochs are planned.

Thank you to CSIRO staff for supporting these observations.

We report photometry of the optical source in NGC 4993 reported by Coulter et al. (LVC GCN 21529), Allam et al. (LVC GCN 21530), Yang et al. (LVC GCN 21531), Melandri et al. (LVC GCN 21532) in response to LIGO/Virgo GW trigger G298048 (LVC, GCN 21513).

The source at  RA = 13:09:48.09 DECL. = -23:22:53.35 was observed with the 1.35-m ANU SkyMapper telescope at Siding Spring Observatory on the night of 2017-08-18 from 10:00:00 to 10:09:40 UTC.

Initial photometry for the candidate’s AB magnitude is: u-band (350/40) = 17.9 +/- 0.15, v-band (384/28) = 17.9 +/- 0.10, g-band (510/156) = 17.76 +/-0.05, r-band (617/156) = 17.20 +/-0.05 and i-band (779/140) = 16.0 +/- 0.30. Note that the u-band is uncertain because the frames were taken at airmass 2.5 to 2.7, and the i-band is highly uncertain due to a rudimentary host subtraction.

As reported in Yoshida et al. 2017 (GCN 21549), we performed z-band imaging
observations for the gravitational wave event G298048 (GCN 21505; 21509; 21513)
with Hyper Suprime-Cam attached to the Subaru telescope on August 18 2017 UT. 
The survey fields include SSS17a (RA = 13:09:48.09 DECL. = -23:22:53.35, 
Coulter et al. 2017; GCN 21529) possibly associated with G298048. After photometric
calibration with Pan-STARRS1 catalog (Chambers et al. 2016) using HSC
pipeline (Bosch et al. 2017), we obtained psf magnitude of z = 17.3, which 
is consistent with the magnitudes reported by Chambers et al. (GCN 21553). 
We did not find a significant variability with > 0.1 mag during
our observations from 5:16 UT until 5:40 UT.

We imaged SSS17a in NGC 4993 (Coutler et al. LVC GCNs 21529), the potential
optical counterpart of LIGO/Virgo G298048 (LVC GCNs 210505, 21509, 21513)
with the g, r, i, z and an array of medium-band filters. The observation
was carried out using two 0.43m telescopes, LSGT and T17 of iTelescope.Net
at the Siding Spring Observatory (Im et al. 2015, JKAS, 48, 207). The
observation started at 2017-08-18 09:47 (UT), and continued for about 30
min until the weather stopped the osbservation. SSS17a is clearly visible
in the images taken. Further analysis of the data is ongoing. Additional
observations are ongoing/planned using these telescopes and the KMTNet 1.5m

A. Trois (INAF/OA-Cagliari), M. Marisaldi (INAF/IASF-Bo and Bergen University),
A. Giuliani (INAF/IASF-Mi), report on behalf of the AGILE Team:

As reported in previous GCNs of the AGILE Team (LVC GCN 21525 and 21526)
at the G298048 event time T0 the 90% localization region (LR) of the HLV
skymap was not accessible to AGILE detectors because of a prolonged Earth
occultation of that portion of the sky.

AGILE is currently spinning and is scanning about 80% of the entire sky
every 7 minutes. The G298048 HLV LR was exposed before and after T0 with a
complex pattern that depends on the instrument boresight revolution and Earth
occultation.

In the analysis results reported below, we use the updated G298048 sky map
(LVC GCN 21527) including the optical transient SSS17a (RA = 13:09:48.09
DECL. = -23:22:53.35, Coulter et al. 2017; LVC GCN 21529) which is
the potential optical counterpart (see also Allam et al. LVC GCN 21530,
Yang et al. LVC GCN 21531, Melandri et al. LVC GCN 21532) to G298048.

The closest in time AGILE-GRID detector exposure of the G298048 LR
starts near T0+950 sec. For an integration time ranging from T0+950 to
T0+1100 sec, we obtained the 3-sigma gamma-ray flux upper limit
UL_1 = 5.7e-08 erg cm^2 s^-1 at energies above 100 MeV at the optical
transient location.

Previously, the closest in time passage of the AGILE-GRID instrument over
the LR occurred at times from T0-1950 to T0-1750 sec before T0. For this
exposure we obtained the 3-sigma gamma-ray flux upper limit UL_2 = 3.4e-08
erg cm^2 s^-1 at energies above 100 MeV at the optical transient location.

We also carried out an analysis on longer timescales. For an integration
time during a 10 ksec time window preceding T0, we obtain an AGILE-GRID
gamma-ray flux upper limit of UL_3 = 2.8e-09 erg cm^-2 s^-1
at the optical transient location at energies above 100 MeV.
For an integration time of 10 ksec following T0, we obtain UL_4 = 3.5e-09
erg cm^-2 s^-1 at energies above 100 MeV at the optical transient location.

No significant new sources were found in our analysis. Additional analysis
of AGILE data is ongoing.

Melandri et al. (LVC GCN 21532) and others.

In the course of Las Cumbres Observatory LIGO followup we observed NGC 4993
from our 1-meter telescopes at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory
in Chile at 2017-08-18 00:15 UT (Arcavi et al.; LCV GCN 21538) and at the
Siding Spring Observatory in Australia at 2017-08-18 09:10 UT. Both images
were taken in the broad w (=g+r+i) filter.

Preliminary aperture photometry, comparing to 7 nearby stars, indicates a
relative increase in brightness of the candidate by 0.11 magnitudes (with
an uncertainty of 0.03 magnitudes) in the ~9 hours between the first and
second epochs.

Further observations and analysis are ongoing.

We analyzed the medium-band data we took for SSS17a at the Siding Spring
Observatory at 2017-08-18.4 (UT) in Im et al. (LVC GCN 21563). The
preliminary magnitude at the medium-band filter m475 centered at 475nm
(Choi & Im JKAS, 50, 71) is m475 = 17.5 +- 0.2 AB mag, somewhat brighter
than g ~ 17.9 mag of Wolf et al. (LVC GCN 21560) taken at the same site at
a similar time. Considering that m475 is similar to the g-band filter, this
prefers a moderate dimming in comparison to g=17.2 +- 0.1 mag at the time
of 2017-08-18.1 (UT) from Simon et al. (LVC GCN 21551) to a brightening as
suggested by Arcavi et al. (LVC GCN 21565). However, currently, the large
uncertainties in the magnitude estimates (mostly due to host galaxy
subtraction problem) makes us difficult to rule out no brightening or even
a slight brightening of the EM counterpart candidate.

FROM:    Kate Alexander at Harvard U  <kalexander@cfa.harvard.edu>

P. K. G. Williams (Harvard), K. D. Alexander (Harvard), and E. Berger
(Harvard) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We investigated observations of the candidate optical counterpart to
LIGO/Virgo trigger G298048 in the NRAO Very Large Array (VLA) data archive.
The field containing the candidate was observed at both 1.51 GHz ("L band")
and 4.89 GHz ("C band") on June 10 and 23, 1984, as part of program AW0110.
The on-source integration times were 11.5 and 5.5 minutes, respectively. We
obtained images generated by the NRAO's VLA/AIPS data calibration pipeline
(L. Sjouwerman, in preparation), which automatically processed the data in
2009.

We see no persuasive evidence for radio emission at the location of either
the host galaxy or the counterpart candidates. We measure image RMS values
of ~180 and ~340 microJy near the candidates in the 1.51 and 4.89 GHz
images, respectively. Taking a flux density upper limit of three times the
RMS and a luminosity distance of 39.5 Mpc, these values correspond to upper
limits on the spectral luminosity of 10^27.0 and 10^27.3 erg/s/Hz at 1.51
and 4.89 GHz. Using the relation between synchrotron emission and star
formation rate presented by Yun & Carilli (2002 ApJ 568 88), the implied
star formation rate of the candidate host galaxy is less than 0.05 solar
masses per year.

For comparison, Alexander et al. (LVC GCNs 21545, 21548) report a VLA
radio detection
of 300 microJy at 9.77 GHz, and Bannister et al. (LVC GCN 21559) report
ATCA radio detections of 600-400 microJy at 8.5--21.2 GHz. These values are
consistent with the archival limits.

We obtained a second epoch of UV and X-ray imaging of SSS17a (Coulter et al.; GCN 21529), the candidate optical counterpart of G298048 (LVC; GCN 21509) with the Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Explorer.  Observations began at 13:30 UT on 2017 August 18.  Compared with our previous epoch of imaging (Evans et al.; GCN 21550), the source has faded significantly at UV wavelengths.  Specifically we measure the following magnitudes (with no host subtraction):

Filter T_start(s) T_stop(s) Exp(s) Mag (Vega) 

u    90029 90164  133 17.42 +/- 0.09 
uvw1 89755 90024  265 18.50 +/- 0.15 
uvm2 89346 94665 1045 20.40 +/- 0.27 
uvw2 90170 90674  496 20.37 +/- 0.32 

Given the relatively flat evolution in the optical and NIR, this suggests significant cooling in the source.

The source remains undetected in the X-rays, with comparable limits to our previous epoch.

Further observations are planned.

D. Kaplan (UWM), T. Murphy (University of Sydney), K. Bannister (CSIRO), C. Lynch (University of Sydney), D. Dobie (University of Sydney) on behalf of the VAST collaboration.

Following Bannister et al. (LVC GCN 21559), who reported ATCA detections of a radio source consistent with the position of NGC 4993 that is also seen with the VLA (Alexander et al. LVC GCN 21548), we present upper limits to the radio emission of any source at the position of the potential optical counterpart, SSS17a (Coulter et al., LVC GCN 21529).

We fit and subtracted a point-source at the optical position of NGC 4993 (13:09:47.706, -23:23:01.79; Skrutskie et al. 2003, 2MASS Extended Source Catalog).  The flux densities were consistent with the values reported by Bannister et al. (LVC GCN 21559).  We then measured the rms noise at the position of SSS17a as well as 3 other source-free positions nearby.  In all cases there was no detectable emission at the position of SSS17a (9.9 arcsec away), and the noise was essentially identical across all positions.  

Assuming that all of the emission originates with the center of NGC 4993, our flux density for the galaxy and 3-sigma upper limits to emission at the position of SSS17a are:

Frequency	NGC 4993 Flux Density	3-sigma Limit for SSS17a
8.5 GHz: 	0.66 mJy			120 uJy
10.5 GHz:	0.54 mJy			150 uJy
16.7 GHz: 	0.42 mJy			130 uJy
21.2 GHz: 	0.34 mJy			140 uJy

Thank you to CSIRO staff for supporting these observations.

S. Eikenberry, K.Ackley, and S. Klimenko (U. Florida) report:

We have investigated archival 2MASS (28 Apr 1998) and Spitzer (12 Oct
2014) infrared observations of the field of SSS17a (Coulter et al. LVC GCN
21529). We find no evidence of a point-like source at this location. While
the presence of the host galaxy somewhat complicates sensitivity
estimates, in the case of 2MASS we have a preliminary estimate for a
3-sigma upper limit of J(Vega) ~ 17.6 +- 0.2 mag, which corresponds to
J(AB) ~ 18.5 +- 0.2 mag. This is a factor of ~2.5 fainter than the
J(AB)=17.5 mag detection of Tanvir et al. (LVC GCN 21544), indicating a
variable or transient nature for this source. More detailed analyses of
the upper limits for both 2MASS and Spitzer are forthcoming.

DATE:    17/08/18 23:00:31 GMT
FROM:    Daniele Malesani at DARK/NBI  <malesani@dark-cosmology.dk>

Daniele Malesani, Darach Watson, and Jens Hjorth (all DARK/NBI), report:

Analysis of the optical and near-infrared data reported through the GCNs 
allows to build the spectral energy distribution of the candidate 
optical counterpart (Coulter et al., GCN 21529; Allam et al., GCN 21530; 
Yang et al., GCN 21531) of the LIGO/Virgo event G298048 (GCN 21509). A 
standard Galactic extinction curve with A_V = 0.34 has been adopted but 
no rest-frame extinction has been included.

We caution that the available data are based on a preliminary analysis 
and are not always strictly simultaneous, though the reported 
variability (at least in the optical) is modest (Arcavi et al., GCN 
21565). Overall, the SED shows a blue continuum in the NIR to optical 
region, reaching a peak around the g band and rapidly decreasing in the 
UV as constrained by the Swift/UVOT measurements (Evans et al., GCN 
21550). The spectral slope in the UV is quite steep, being well 
represented by an exponential tail or a very steep power law (spectral 
index ~3.7 on Aug 18.16 UT; and ~ 5 on Aug 18.57 UT).

A blackbody with T ~ 8500 K broadly represents the available data at a 
mean epoch Aug 18.1 UT (black line in the plot). Assuming an isotropic, 
spherically symmetric emitter, the radius of the blackbody source would 
be approximately 10^15 cm for a distance of 40 Mpc. At 55 ks after the 
explosion, this would imply a relativistic expansion velocity. As noted 
by Cenko et al. (GCN 21572), the later Swft/UVOT measurement indicate 
cooling in the source, implying further expansion and confirming the 
relativistic velocity.

The SED is clearly atypical for optical afterglows of long and short 
GRBs, as also highlighted by the lack of detection in the X-ray band 
(Evans et al., GCN 21550).

A plot showing the counterpart SED is posted online at:

http://www.astro.ku.dk/~malesani/GRB/170817A/SED_opt.png

Data were grouped in quasi-simultaneous sets and were collected from the 
following reports:
- Aug 18.0 UT (red triangles): Yang et al. (GCN 21531); Nicholl et al. 
(GCN 21541); Tanvir & Levan (GCN 21544); Simon et al. (GCN 21551);

FROM:    Philip Cowperthwaite at Harvard U  <pcowperthwaite@cfa.harvard.edu>

P.S. Cowperthwaite (Harvard), M. Nicholl (Harvard), E. Berger (Harvard)

We construct a preliminary UV/Optical/NIR SED for the potential optical
counterpart SSS17a first reported by Coulter et al. (GCN 21529). These data
are compiled from the photometry reported in circulars submitted during the
first night of follow-up. We correct these data for extinction due to
reddening along the line of sight to the host galaxy NGC 4993.

We perform a preliminary fit with a blackbody function to this SED finding
an effective temperature of T = 8000 K and an effective radius of R = 6e14
cm.

We test the sensitivity of our fit to the UV flux, refitting with the
Swift/UVOT data excluded. We find T = 10,200 K and R ~ 4e14 cm.

In both cases, the large expansion radius and short time since explosion (t
~ 1 day) suggest an expansion velocity of >0.2c. This is too fast to be
explained by supernova ejecta, but is consistent with the expansion
velocities expected for relativistic BNS/NS-BH merger ejecta.

These values, and the inferred relativistic expansion, are consistent with
the results of Malesani et al. (GCN 21577).

We report the second epoch for DLT17ck/SSS17a, the possible counterpart of G298048 in NGC 4993 detected by Coulter et al. (LVC GCN  21529), Allam et  al. (LVC GCN 21530), Yang et al.

Using data from the PROMPT 5 0.41m telescope located at CTIO, DLT40 observation began at 2017 August 18.99 UT and shows the source at magnitude R = 18.00 +/- 0.06 mag. Compared with our discovery detections, R~17.3 mag in Yang et al. (LVC GCN 21531), the source is declining. We also report last our non-detection at 2017 July 27.99 UT, during the monitoring of NGC4993 with the DLT40 search. The magnitude limit is up to 19.1 mag (open filter scaled to r band).

On behalf of the DESGW+community team:

We report further i- and z-band photometry from DECam imaging of
the possible optical counterpart to G298048 first identified in Coulter et
al. (LVC GCN 21529), and further reported on by Allam et al. (LVC GCN
21530), Valenti et al. (LVC GCN 21531), Melandri et al. (LVC GCN 21532) and
Arcavi et al. (GCN 21538). Observations were obtained on 2017-08-19 at
23:23 UTC.

We find preliminary PSF magnitudes of

i = 17.8 +/- 0.1 mag
z = 17.6 +/- 0.1. mag

In images obtained the previous night (2017-08-18 at 00:04 UT), we measured
i ~ z ~ 17.5 mag (Nicholl et al., LVC GCN 21541). This indicates a fading
of
~0.3 mag in i-band over the course of 1 day. This value is consistent with
that
expected for an afterglow or rapidly-evolving kilonova.

These magnitudes are determined from differential PSF photometry of DECam
images relative to Pan-STARRs 3pi catalogs.

Further analysis is ongoing.

Under the extended Public extened ESO Spectroscopic Survey for
Transient Objects (ePESSTO; see Smartt et al. 2015, A&A, 579, 40
http://www.pessto.org), we report spectra of the optical/NIR candiate
counterpart of the gravitational wave source G298048 in NGC4993.

This object was discovered by Coulter et al. (GCN 21529, named SSS17a)
and further detected by Allam et al. (GCN 21530), Yang et al. (GCN
21531), Melandri et al. (GCN 21532), Nicholl et al. (GCN21541), Tanvir
& Levan (GCN21544), Chambers et al. (GCN 21553), Yoshida et al. (GCN
21549).

The observations were performed on the ESO New Technology Telescope at
La Silla with the EFOSC2 instrument in spectroscopic mode starting
from 2018-08-18 at 23:20 UT, using the Gr11 and Gr16 which provide
coverage 3345-9995 at a resolution between 260-396 (v = 1150 - 756
km/s) for a 1.5" slit, which was used in roughly 1.5-2.0" seeing. 

Quick look reductions (not including fringe and flat correction)
indicate the spectrum is highly unusual for a nearby transient. 

We have dereddening the spectrum with A_v = 0.34, for Milky 
Way correction. 

The continuum is featureless, similar to the report of the first
Magellan spectrum in Drout et al. (GCN 21547). But it peaks at 5500
and falls off rapidly in the blue. This is consistent with the Swift
colours reported and the fading U-band and UV flux. The red part
(beyond 5000Angs) can be fit with a black-body temperature of around
6000K or a power law.  But neither are consistent with the turn over
in the blue.  There are no strong features in the blue that indicate
line absorption or could be identified with known transitions.  There
are no Balmer lines, no Ca II H&K, or Si II absorption seen in
supernova-like transients. 

We can certainly conclude this is not a young supernova of any type in
this host, nor is it consistent with being a background supernova of 
any standard type. The UV dimming and maintaining of the red and NIR
flux appears broadly consistent with many flavours of kilonova models. 

Further observations with ePESSTO will continue over the next 4
nights, combining EFOSC2 and SOFI observations. During the 5 years of
PESSTO spectroscopic surveys, this transient stands out as exceptional
in its colours, evolution and spectra (supporting the ideas in Foley
GCN 21557).

P. Wiseman, T.-W. Chen, J. Greiner, and P. Schady (all MPE Garching)
report on behalf of the GROND team:

We observed the field of the of the transient source SSS17a in NCG 4993 
(RA =
13:09:48.09 DEC = -23:22:53.35, Coulter et al. GCN #21529, Allam et al. 
GCN
#21530, Yang et al. GCN #21531, Melandri et al. GCN #21532), possibly 
associated
with LIGO/Virgo trigger G298048, simultaneously in g'r'i'z'JHK with 
GROND (Greiner
et al. 2008,PASP 120, 405) mounted at the 2.2 m MPG telescope at ESO La 
Silla
Observatory(Chile).

Observations started at 23:15 UT on August 18th 2017. They were 
performed at an
average seeing of 1.8" and at an average airmass of 1.4.

We clearly detect a single point source at the location of the 
transient, although
  the strong host contribution hinders photometric accuracy.

Based on the first 13.8 min of total exposures in g'r'i'z' and 12.4 min 
in JHK, we
estimate preliminary magnitudes (all in AB system) of

g' = 17.9 +/- 0.1 mag,
r' = 17.2 +/- 0.1 mag,
i' = 17.2 +/- 0.1 mag,
z' = 16.8 +/- 0.1 mag,
J = 16.6 +/- 0.2 mag,
H = 16.9 +/- 0.2 mag, and
K = 16.8 +/- 0.2 mag.

There appears to be little change in the optical brightness of the 
source: we
compare our magnitudes to the  g = 17.76 mag and r = 17.20 mag from 14 
hours
previous,reported by SkyMapper (Wolf et al. GCN #21560); and to the i,z 
= 17.25
mag of Pan-STARRS (Chambers et al. GCN #21553) and z = 17.3 from HSC-z 
(Yoshida
et al. GCN #21561) from 19 hours previous.

On the other hand, the object has brightened significantly in the NIR 
over the
last 24 hours. We compare the J band to the value of 17.5 mag (AB) from
VISTA/VIRCAM reported by Tanvir et al. (GCN #21544), while the K band 
(now 14.9
in Vega) is much brighter than the 16.9 mag (Vega) reported by Singer 
et al.
(GCN #21552).

Given magnitudes are calibrated against Pan-STARRS zeropoints/2MASS 
field stars
and are not corrected for the expected Galactic foreground extinction
corresponding to a reddening of E_(B-V)= 0.1 mag in the direction of 
the
candidate (Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011).

After the Milky Way extinction correction, we fitted our colour SED 
assuming a
black body (no K-correction applied), which indicates a temperature of 
5333 +/-
243 K.

Lyman et al (GCN 21582). We confirm some of the results of Lyman et al: a peak 
between 5000-6000 Angs, rapid fall-off in the blue, and no match to known 
supernova types. The colour temperature is best matched by a blackbody with 
T~5000K, after dereddening by a Milky Way E(B-V)=0.1053. The UV flux appears
suppressed relative to a simple blackbody.

This shows significant cooling compared to T~8000K one day previous, as
reported by Malesani et al (GCN 21577) and Cowperthwaite et al (GCN 21578).
The blackbody radius (~8e14 cm) indicates an average velocity ~0.1c, suggesting
the expansion has now slowed compared to those earlier estimates (0.2-0.3c).

We note the possibility of weak, broad bumps at ~5000 and ~6000 Ang in our
quick extractions.

We performed follow-up observations for the gravitational wave
event G298048 with Hyper Suprime-Cam attached to the Subaru
telescope from 5:20 to 6:00 on August 19 2017 UT. We surveyed the
same sky area as our previous observation (GCN 21549) with HSC-z
band filter. SSS17a, which is the most promising candidate of the
optical counterpart of G298048 (GCN 21529), was still bright. The
rough estimation of the z-band magnitude of the object was ~17.7
(AB). Further analysis is ongoing.

The sky fields observed by this survey are listed below:

We are observing the optical transient SSS17a (Coulter et al. - GCN 21529, Allam et al. - GCN 21530, Yang et al.- GCN 21531, Melandri et al. - GCN 21532) and its host galaxy NGC 4993 with the Very Long Baseline Array.

 
We are observing at a central frequency of 8.7 GHz with a bandwidth of 256 MHz.

The first observation took place from 2017-08-17 19:58UT to 2017-08-18 01:34UT.  

Analysis of the data will take place after correlation, in 7-10 days.  

Two subsequent epochs are planned in the coming three days.

FROM:    Kate Alexander at Harvard U  <kalexander@cfa.harvard.edu>

K.D. Alexander (Harvard), W. Fong (Northwestern), and E. Berger (Harvard)
report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We analyzed observations taken with the Very Large Array beginning on 2017
Aug 18 at 22:04:57 UT (1.39 d after the Fermi trigger time; Blackburn et
al., LVC GCN 21506). In two hours of observations at a mean frequency of
10.0 GHz, we detect the source reported in our previous VLA observations
(Alexander et al., LVC GCN 21545; 21548) and in ATCA observations
(Bannister et al., LVC GCN 21559) at a similar flux level. We measure an
improved position of:

RA = 13:09:47.704

Dec =-23:23:02.45

with an uncertainty of 0.1â€ in each coordinate. We note that the beam size
in our images is 3.1â€ by 1.4â€, significantly smaller than our previous VLA
observations. The lack of variability over a 19.9 hr period along with full
spatial coincidence with NGC 4993 indicates that this radio emission is
originating from the host galaxy.

We further note that there is no detected emission at the position of the
optical transient (Coulter et al., LVC GCN 21529) down to a 3-sigma limit
of 17 microJy.

We report continued Pan-STARRS imaging of the transient SSS17a/DLT17ck
in NGC4339 in filters i, z and y (see Chambers et al. GCN 21553 for
more details of filters, photometry, methods etc).

Our reference stack and calibrations provide rapid reliable photometry
with the host removed and we will continue to post updates while it is
visible from Hawaii.  A series of short exposures to avoid sky
saturation in twilight in each of i, z, and y provide average nightly
magnitudes (AB) of 

MJD             i       err 
57983.23	17.24	0.06
57984.24	17.91	0.05

57983.23	17.38	0.10
57984.24	17.59	0.07

This confirms the fading seen in the DECam images (Nicholl et
al. GCN 21580), and is consistent with the other reports of fading (e.g. Yoshida et al. GCN
21586, Yang et al. 21579,  Arcavi et al. 21581).

The fading in i-band and bluer bands is clearly more pronounced than
in y-band and distinct from the rising NIR (Wiseman et al GCN 21584). 

This rate of fading is quantitatively similar to that of the kilonova
or merging NS models (Kasen et al. 2015, Barnes & Kasen 2013, Tanaka et
al. 2014). And is uncommon for the populations of known nearby
transients.

We observed object SSS17a (Coulter et al., GCN 21529; Allam et al., GCN 
21530; Yang et al., GCN 21531) possibly associated with the LIGO/Virgo 
event G298048 (GCN 21509), using the Nordic Optical Telescope located in 
La Palma (Canary Islands, Spain).

Observations were carried out around Aug 18.85 UT (1.32 days after the 
GW event), and consisted of 9 min exposure in each of the J and K 
filters. Conditions were difficult due to the large airmass (4.0 to 5.5) 
and the still bright twilight sky, which led to an unusually elongated 
PSF due to imperfect focusing.

SSS17a is well visible in the J image and faintly detected in K. Based 
on the 2MASS catalog, we provide preliminary magnitudes J = 16.23 +- 
0.11 and K = 15.88 +- 0.25 (both Vega). We note that an extra error may 
arise from the non-circular PSF and the uneven background around the 
nearby NGC 4993.

Our fluxes are earlier and fainter than the GROND measurements (Wiseman 
et al., GCN 21584), confirming the brightening of SSS17a at NIR 
wavelengths and the overall cooling trend noted by several authors 
(e.g., Cenko et al., GCN 21572; Lyman et al., GCN 21582; Wiseman et al., 
GCN 21584).

We acknowledge excellent support of the NOT visiting observer, Auni 
Somero, in carrying out this difficult observation.

We observed object SSS17a (Coulter et al., GCN 21529; Allam et al., GCN 21530; Yang et al., GCN 21531, Melandri et al., GCN 21532) possibly associated with the LIGO/Virgo event G298048 (GCN 21509), with the ESO Very Large Telescope UT 2 (Kueyen) equipped with the X-shooter spectrograph, covering the wavelength range 3000-25000 AA. Observations started at 23:16 UT on 2017-08-18, during the twilight, roughly 1.5 days after the burst and consisted of 4 exposures of 600 s each.

The transient is bright, well detected in the acquisition image, and clearly visible in all the spectral range. After a preliminary reduction the continuum appears to be similar to that predicted by kilonova models (Tanaka & Hotokezaka 2013, ApJ, 775, 113; Kasen et al. 2015, MNRAS, 450, 1777, Rosswog et al. 2016, arxiv1611.09822).

K. Wiersema (University of Leicester), S. Covino (INAF-OAB),  A. Melandri 
(INAF-OAB) and  E. Palazzi (INAF-IAFS Bo) report on behalf of a large 
collaboration:

We obtained optical linear polarimetry measurements of object SSS17a
(Coulter et al., GCN 21529; Allam et al., GCN 21530; Yang et al., GCN 21531,
Melandri et al., GCN 21532) possibly associated with the LIGO/Virgo event
G298048 (GCN 21509). We used the ESO Very Large Telescope UT1 (Antu)
equipped with the FORS2 instrument.  Observations started on 23:09 UT
on 18 August 2017, i.e. during twilight, and continued until the
source reached airmass 2.

FORS2 uses a Wollaston element and a rotating halfwave plate to perform
imaging polarimetry; additionally we used the FORS2 R_special filter (similar
to R) . We obtained a large series of imaging polarimetry datasets, each
consisting of 4 angles of the wave plate, using exposure times of 60 seconds
for each exposure; the transient is bright in our data.
In a preliminary analysis of a subset of our data, we find no evidence of optical
linear polarisation, with a preliminary upper limit on the linear polarisation of
P_linear < 1%. We expect this value to change somewhat through a more thorough
 analysis in the future, e.g. using more accurate models to correct for the
host galaxy emission and rapidly varying twilight contribution.

Our polarisation limit is a first for a kilonova candidate, and indicates a relatively
smooth emission region, with no evidence of significant asymmetry at the time
of observations. Similarly, this limit may indicate that there is no large contribution
of non-thermal emission in the observed wavelength at the time of observations.

We acknowledge excellent support from the ESO staff, J. M. Corral-Santana and
S. Brilliant, and in particular the visiting observer, M. Lendl,  who so kindly gave
up some of their observing time.

which is 0.5 mag fainter than the psf magnitude obtained with Subaru/HSC 
on August 18 UT (Yoshida et al. GCN 21561). The fading nature of SSS17a 
in the z-band is consistent with the reports in Nicholl et al. (GCN 21580)

We continued the optical/NIR follow-up monitoring of the LIGO/Virgo GW trigger G298048 (LVC GCN Circ. 21509, 21513) with the 60-cm robotic telescope REM located at the La Silla Observatory (Chile) by performing targeted observations of catalogued galaxies in the LVC skymap. The observations were carried out from 23:31 UT on 2017 Aug 18 to 01:18 UT on on 2017 Aug 19, simultaneously in the g, r, i, z, J, H and K bands.

We clearly detect in all bands the optical source reported by Coulter et al. (LVC GCN 21529, 21567), Allam et al. (LVC GCN 21530), Yang et al. (LVC GCN 21531, 21579), Melandri et al.

With respect to our previous epoch (Melandri et al. LVC GCN 21532), preliminary analysis shows that the source is significantly fainter in the g-band and displays no variation in the r-band. Analysis and calibration is ongoing and further observations are planned.

We continued to observe the optical counterpart candidate of LIGO/Virgo
G298048 (LVC GCNs 210505, 21509, 21513), SSS17a (Coutler et al. LVC GCN
21529), using the KMTNet 1.5m telescopes and other small telescopes. KMTNet
is an observing system made of three 1.5m telescopes at the Siding Spring
Observatory (SSO), the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO), and
the Cerro-Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO). BVRI images were taken
at each KMTNet site in 2017-08-18 and 08-19 UT.

Preliminary magnitudes in R-band shows continued dimming of SSS17a (e.g.,
Im et al. LVC GCN 21566), and more interestingly, SSR17a seems to be fading
faster in the last epoch data taken at SSO (see also Melandri et al. LVC
GCN 21596).

2017-08-18.98 17.7 +- 0.1 CTIO

2017-08-19.35 18.4 +- 0.2 SSO

The observation using small telescopes at SSO was carried out too (see Im
et al. LVC GCN 21563), and the images taken with these telescopes also
suggest faster dimming. The observations using the KMTNet telescopes and
the small telescopes are ongoing.

region of the skymap, the sequence was defined to maximize the contained
localization probability.
The images were taken in the r_SDSS filter with an exposure of 80s (split
in two dithered exposures of 40 s each). The observations started at
2017-08-17T 23:44:50.964 UTC and finished at 2017-08-18T 00:08:46.388.
Automatic data reduction with the VSTTube pipeline (Grado et al. 2012

T.-W. Chen, P. Wiseman, J. Greiner, and P. Schady (all MPE Garching) 
report on behalf of the GROND team:

We observed the field of the transient source SSS17a in NCG 4993 
(RA = 13:09:48.09 DEC = -23:22:53.35, discovered by Coulter et al. 
GCN #21529), possibly associated with LIGO/Virgo trigger G298048, 
simultaneously in g'r'i'z'JHK with GROND (Greiner et al. 2008,
PASP 120, 405) mounted at the 2.2 m MPG telescope at ESO La Silla 
Observatory (Chile).

Observations started at 23:15 UT on August 19th 2017. They were 
performed at an average seeing of 1.8" and at an average airmass 
of 1.4.

We detected a single point source at the location of the transient, 
although the strong host contribution hinders photometric accuracy.

Based on the first 11.7 min of total exposures in g'r'i'z' and 
13.2 min in JHK, we estimate preliminary magnitudes using aperture
photometry (all in AB system) of

g' = 19.8 +/- 0.2 mag, 
r' = 18.1 +/- 0.1 mag, 
i' = 18.0 +/- 0.1 mag, 
z' = 16.8 +/- 0.1 mag, 
J = 16.4 +/- 0.2 mag, 
H = 16.6 +/- 0.2 mag, and 
K = 16.6 +/- 0.2 mag.

We confirm that the transient significantly declines in optical 
brightness (Yoshida et al. GCN #21586, Chambers et al. GCN #21590,
Tominaga et al. GCN #21595, Melandri et al. GCN #21596, Im et al. 
GCN #21597, Valenti et al. GCN #21606), but the transient keeps 
flat in z'JHK-band brightness for 1 day compared to our previous 
report (Wiseman et al. GCN #21584).

Given magnitudes are calibrated against Pan-STARRS1 field stars 
as well as 2MASS field stars and are not corrected for the expected 
Galactic foreground extinction corresponding to a reddening of 
E_(B-V)= 0.1 mag in the direction of the candidate (Schlafly & 
Finkbeiner 2011).

We acknowledge the excellent help in obtaining these data from 
Angela Hempel on La Silla.

performed a series of exposures in the R and Clear filters, with an 
elevation decreasing from 40 degrees. The weather conditions were good, 
with a mean seeing of 2-3 arcsec.

We detect an excess at the position of the potential counterpart in C 
filter at 23:54 UT. Strong contamination from the nearby galaxy prevents 
a precise brightness estimate without galaxy substraction. Further 
analysis is in progress.

The VIRT is still in its commissioning phase.

Swift has continued to monitor the position of the likely EM counterpart to the LVC trigger G298048. We have now collected a total of 19.3 ks at the position of the optical source first reported by Coulter et al. (LVC GCN 21529).

In the summed data a faint X-ray source is detected at a position of (RA,Dec)=194.45112, -23.3845 degrees which is equivalent to:
RA (J2000.0) = 13h 09m 48.27s
Dec (J2000.0) = -23d 23â€™ 04.3â€

with an uncertainty of 6.4 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). This source is 11.3 arcsec from the position reported by Coulter et al.

The mean count rate is  6.5 (+2.8,-2.2) e-4 ct/sec which corresponds to a 0.3-10 keV flux of 2.6 (+1.1, -0.9) e-14 erg/cm^2/s. Assuming a distance of 42.5 Mpc (Dâ€™Elia et al., LVC Circ. 21592) this corresponds to a luminosity of 5.6 (+2.4, -1.9)e39 erg/s. In the data binned per Swift pointing, the peak detection is at ~twice this level.

At the current time we do not have sufficient statistics to confirm whether the object is variable. We also note that, given the probable radio emission from the host (Alexander, Fong & Berger, LVC Circ. 21548) the host may be a weak AGN, at the current time we cannot rule out the possibility that the X-rays come from the host galaxy rather than the optical afterglow.

Further observations are planned.

The decline rate 0.6 mag per day is still consistent with some of the
kilonova models (Kasen et al. 2015, Barnes & Kasen 2013, Tanaka et
al. 2014). 

The very rapid decline (and weak high energy emission) may explain why
transients of these types have not been recovered and recognised
independently in ground-based wide-field surveys to date, before the
LIGO-Virgo era.

For example at d=100Mpc, this transient would fade from around i=19.2
to 21.7 in four days in i-band (and would be fainter and faster in g,
r and broad composite filters).  Making it difficult to recover and
recognise over multiple nights in "~10^3 deg per night" surveys such
as PTF, Pan-STARRS, La Silla Quest, Skymapper, CRTS.  And well beyond
the wider, shallower, ASASSN and ATLAS sensitivities.

A. Pozanenko (IKI), E. Mazaeva (IKI), A. Volnova (IKI),  P. Minaev 
(IKI), M. Krugov (AFIF) report on behalf of IKI-GW follow-up collaboration:

We observed  the field of  LIGO/Virgo trigger G298048 (LVC GCNs 21509, 
21513) and the error circle of GMB/Fermi short burst GRB 170817A 
(Connaughton et al., GCN 21506) with RC-1000 and ASA-500 telescopes of 
CHILESCOPE observatory located at W 70d 34m S20d 27m. The observations 
started on Aug 17 (UT) 23:17:16 in clear filter. The last image was 
recorded on 2017-08-18T00:59:48.

We cover central part of G298048 localization with typical limiting 
magnitude of 20m at 60 s exposure in each image. The covering map can be 
found in
http://grb.rssi.ru/GRB170817A/bayestar_RC1000%20coverage.png

The OT candidate found by Coulter et al. (LVC GCN 21529), the DLT17ck 
(Sheng Yang et al., GCN 21531) is out of the coverage in the first epoch 
of the observations.

We also cover northern part of GBM/Fermi  localization?  1-sigma 
containment, statistical only (Connaughton et al., GCN 21506). The 
coverage of the GBM localization is about 20%. Typical limiting 
magnitude of 17.5m at 60 s exposure in each image. The covering map can 
be found in
http://grb.rssi.ru/GRB170817A/GRB170817A_GBM_coverage_ASA500.png

The detailed investigation of the fields is underway.

We are grateful to the remote staff of the observatory for timely 
observations.

SUBJECT: LIGO/Virgo G298048: On the kick velocity and age of the binary Neutron Stars Progenitor
DATE:    17/08/20 15:40:35 GMT
FROM:    Vladimir Lipunov at Moscow State U/Krylov Obs  <lipunov2007@gmail.com>

V.M.Lipunov,
Lomonosov Moscow State University, Sternberg Astronomical Institute

There are several very important arguments  for reality SSS17a as 
the kilonova  candidate  was published in LVC GCN. There are relativictic 
expansion  (see Nichol etal., LVC GCN 21585;) and big distance 
(delta ~ 3.9Mpc) 
between host galaxy explositions   ( D'Elia et al.,  LVC GCN 21592).

I point out that we can obtain minimal radial space velosity of the 
progenitor of the G298048:

      V_min = delta/T_Universe = 3.9 Mpc / 13.7 10^10 yrs  ~ 300 km/sec.

From other hand, because kick velosity realy is not more than 1000 km/s, 
we received typical age of the binary NS's as several billion years.

This is not contadict to Scenario Machine population synthesis of the 
NS+NS star merging rates evolution in Universe (Lipunov et al., 
1995, Evolution of  the Double Neutron Star Merging Rate and the 
Cosmological Origin of Gamma-Ray Burst Sources,1995,
Astrophysical Journal v.454, p.593; Lipunov & 
Pruzhinskaya; MNRAS, Vol. 440,  1193-1199, 2014.

From the other hand diference between NGC 4993 galaxy redshift and 
Kilonova ( D'Elia et al.,  LVC GCN 21592) may be explained by fast moving 
relativistic shell where some absobtion lines can be formed.

The NS+NS merging rate evolution from Lipunov et al., 1995 is available at

T. Nakaoka, K. S. Kawabata, M. Kawabata, H. Nagashima, and 
Y. Utsumi (Hiroshima University) on behalf of J-GEM collaboration.

We performed H-band imaging of the possible counterpart of G298048,
SSS17a in NGC 4993 identified by Coulter et al. (LVC GCN  21529),
with HONIR on the 1.5-m Kanata telescope at Higashi-Hiroshima
Observatory, Japan.

Because of low-elevation observation (height~10 deg) during bright
twilight, the foreground sky level was still high and SSS17a was
considerably faint (~3 sigma) in our stacked image. We performed
a forced aperture photometry and estimated a preliminary magnitude
in AB system of

   H = 16.7 (2017 August 20.424-429 UT; MJD 57985.424-429)

The magnitude is calibrated against 2MASS field stars. Further 
analysis is in progress.

collaboration report:

In response to the LIGO/Virgo binary neutron star candidate G298048 on 
Aug 17 (GCNC 21509), we used the JGT 0.6m robotic telescope at the 
BOOTES-5 station at Observatorio Astronómico Nacional de San Pedro Mártir (México) 
to image the 15 galaxies in the GLADE Catalogue (GCN 21516) starting on 
Aug 18.21 UT. The potential optical candidate (GCN 21529) was only 
imaged on Aug 19.21 UT, with the images quality being affected by the 
very high airmass and the twilight sky. The optical candidate (SSS17a) is 
only barely visible in the outskirts of the NGC 4993 galaxy. A more 
detailed analysis of the data is in progress.

We thank the staff of Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro Mártir.

[GCN OPS NOTE(21aug17): Per author's request, (a) the SSS17a name was corrected
for a typo, (b) Lee's name was corrected, (c) OAN's name was corrected, and

We are observing the LIGO localisation region (LVC GCN 21513) with the
Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) at a central
frequency of 1345 MHz with a bandwidth of 192 MHz. As the array is still
undergoing commissioning, we are using a nominal 12 (of 36) antennas,
although other site activities may cause that number to vary from one
observation to the next.

Our observing strategy consists of 3 pointings containing approximately
90% of the LIGO localisation region. Each pointing consists of a 5.5 x 5.5
degree square grid of 36 beams, though the exact number captured may
also vary. The first pointing is centered at

RA = 13:09:21.60
Dec = -25:00:00.00

and contains ~48% of the localisation region and the positions of 35
target galaxies (Cook et al. LVC GCN 21519) including NGC 4993, the
host of the possible optical counterpart SSS17a
(Coulter et al. LVC GCN 21529). Observations began at 2017-08-19
05:34:32 (UT) and are ongoing.

Processing and analysis of the first pointing is underway.

Thank you to CSIRO staff for supporting these observations.

We obtained X-ray imaging of the optical counterpart of SSS17a (Coulter et
al.; GCN21529), the candidate optical counterpart of G298048 (LVC; GCN
21509) in the 3 â€“ 79 keV band with NuSTAR.  Observations began at
2017-08-18T05:26:09 UT and ended at 2017-08-18T19:46:09, with a total
exposure of 24 ksec.  We did not detect any X-ray emission in a circular
50â€™â€™ extraction region centered on the position of the optical counterpart,
with a 3-sigma threshold of 1.4 x 10-14 erg/cm^2/s in the 3-10 keV band,
assuming an X-ray spectrum with a photon power law index of -2.   No source
was detected in the 10-60 keV band, however additional analysis is ongoing
to place limits on possible line emission from nuclear decays. We note that
the NuSTAR hard X-ray band is not sensitive to X-ray emission from star
formation in the host galaxy, and there is no known AGN activity in this
source.

Further NuSTAR observations are planned.

In a preliminary analysis using background subtraction of the host galaxy NGC4339 through rotational masking, a photometric calibration using the star NOMAD-10666-0296310 (R=17.35) yields a magnitude of the optical transient R=20.05 +/- 0.15.

(CPPM/CNRS), A. Kouchner (APC/Universite Paris Diderot), T. Pradier (IPHC/Universite
de Strasbourg) report on behalf of the ANTARES Collaboration:

The refined location of the LIGO/Virgo G298048 event (90% confidence level contour
Bayestar-HLV) falls outside the optimum field of view of ANTARES (as defined with
upward going events). GCN #21522 reported the results of the upward going neutrino search.
As a consequence, we have performed a dedicated analysis looking for down-going neutrino
candidates in the on-line ANTARES data stream. Cuts on the quality of the track reconstruction
and an energy proxy have been used to reduce the false alarm rate in such a way that one
event matching in time (+/- 500 s) and direction (90% C.L contour) with G298048 would
result in a 3-sigma excess.

The ANTARES visibility, for down-going events, at the time of the alert together with
the 90% contour of the probability map are shown in:
https://www.cppm.in2p3.fr/~dornic/events/G298048/gw190817_visi_down.png <https://www.cppm.in2p3.fr/~dornic/events/G298048/gw190817_visi_down.png> (gwantares/GW@ANT31).

No down-going muon neutrino candidate events were recorded by ANTARES within the 90% C.L.
contour and  during a +/- 500 s time-window centered on the G298048 event time. An extended
search during +/- 1 hour yields no coincidence.

An estimate of the upper limit on the associated neutrino fluence will be sent in a subsequent
circular.

ANTARES, being installed in the Mediterranean Deep Sea, is the largest neutrino detector in the
Northern Hemisphere. It is primarily sensitive to astrophysical neutrinos in the TeV-PeV energy
range. At 10 TeV, the median angular resolution for muon neutrinos is below 0.5 degrees.

We continued to monitor the strong optical counterpart candidate of
LIGO/Virgo G298048 (GCNs 210505, 21509, 21513), SSS17a/DLT17ck(Coutler et

GCN 21538; also see notes below for a list of optical/NIR observation

telescopes and other small telescopes (Im et al. GCNs 21563, 21566, 21597)
at three sites , the Siding Spring Observatory (SSO), the South African

medium-band images at 825, 875, 925, 975 nm.

We confirm that the object is fading in optical and its continuum shape has
been becoming redder as time goes on (e.g., Cenko et al. GCN 21572; Lyman

in NGC4339 in filters i, z and y (see Chambers et al. GCN 21553 for
more details of filters, photometry, methods etc).

Our reference stack and calibrations provide rapid reliable photometry

visible from Hawaii.  A series of short exposures to avoid sky
saturation in twilight in each of i, z, and y provide average nightly
magnitudes (AB) as follows. 

Pan-STARRS is observing at lower altitude than it has ever done, Poor
conditions and airmass>3 hampered the fourth night of observing (57986

but no detection in i and y. The forced photometry in the z-band at
the position of the transient is reported. The quick estimates for i
and y need to be verified.

We observed  the possible counterpart SSS17a/DLT17ck (Coulter et al. 
GCN 21529;  Yang et al., GCN 21531) of LIGO/Virgo trigger G298048 (LVC 
GCNs 21509, 21513)  with RC-1000 telescope of CHILESCOPE observatory. 
The observations carried out in clear filter in two epochs, on Aug. 19 
and Aug.20.

Photometry of the transient SSS17a/DLT17ck is following

Date       UT start  Filter    OT   Err UpLim (3 sigma)


2017-08-19 23:30:33   CR       16.7 0.2 21.9
2017-08-20 23:21:09   CR       18.5 0.2 22.0

The photometry is based on several nearby USNO-B1.0 stars (R2). The 
photometry  is still preliminary and required  careful estimation of 
NGC4339 influence. Nevertheless it is evident the source is fading 
significantly which is confirmed by many observations (e.g. Im et al., 
GCN 21632 and references in the GCN 21632).

We have observed a 20 x 20 deg field-of-view centered on the  LIGO/Virgo G298048 localization region  (LVC GCN #21513) with the Murchison Widefield Array.  Observations occurred on 2017-08-18, 2017-08-19, 2017-08-20, 2017-08-21, and 2017-08-22, all from roughly 07:00 UT to 09:30 UT, at a central frequency of 185 MHz.  Note that the array is in the process of being reconfigured, so only 5/16 of the tiles are operational.  Analysis of this data is underway, and subsequent epochs are planned.

R. Chornock (Ohio University) and E. Berger (Harvard) report on behalf of a

We have been obtaining a sequence of near-infrared spectroscopy (range 1-1.8 
microns) of the optical counterpart (SSS17a: Coulter et al., GCN 21529; Allam et 
al., GCN 21530) of LIGO/Virgo G298048 (GCNs 21509, 21513) using FLAMINGOS2 on 
Gemini-South (PI: Chornock).

Our initial spectra, taken on 20170819 at 00:45 UT (~1.5 days after the 
LIGO/Virgo event) have a smooth blue continuum.  Data taken the following night 
show a few broad, low-amplitude features starting to develop.  An initial 
reduction of data taken on 20170821 at 23:40 UT (~4.5 days after the LIGO/Virgo 
event) shows that these features (including a possible spectral peak near 1.05 
microns) have strengthened.  Analysis is ongoing and further observations are 
planned to constrain the potential presence of lanthanide opacities in the 
near-infrared.

started at 2017-08-19 05:34 UT and ended at 2017-08-19 07:58 UT.

We do not detect any emission at the position of the possible optical
counterpart SSS17a (Coulter et al. LVC GCN 21529), or its candidate
host galaxy NGC 4993. The upper limit for NGC 4993 is consistent with
a spectral index of -0.7 found by fitting the measured results from

and the CALET collaboration:

The CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) was operating at the trigger time
of G298048 (The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration,
GCN Circ. 21509).  No CGBM on-board trigger occurred at the time
of the event.  Based on the updated LVC localization sky map
(preliminary-LALInference.fits.gz), none of the probability area was in the
field-of-view of the CGBM/HXM.  However, 99% of the summed probability was
inside the field-of-view of the CGBM/SGM.  The CGBM/SGM boresight position
(R.A., Dec. = 223.8 deg, 43.4 deg) was 73 deg off-axis from the maximum LVC
probability location (The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration,
GCN Circ. 21527).

Based on the analysis of the light curve data with 0.125 sec time resolution
from -60 sec to 60 sec from the trigger time, we found no significant excess
around the trigger time in either the HXM (7-3000 keV) or the SGM (40 keV -28 MeV)
data.  The incident angle of SGM to the position of SSS17a (Coulter et al.,
GCN Circ. 21529) was 71 deg.  Assuming the association of GRB 170817A
(Connaughton et al., GCN Circ. 21506) and SSS17a, we estimated the upper
limit of the SGM.  The 7-sigma upper limit of SGM using alpha=-0.9 and Epeak=130 keV
(Goldstein et al., GCN Circ. 21528) is 5.5e-7 erg/cm2/s in the 10-1000 keV band
at 1 s exposure assuming no shielding by ISS structures.  This estimated upper
limit is at the similar level to the reported peak flux, 7.3e-7 erg/cm2/s, of
GRB 170817A by Fermi-GBM.  We further noticed that the position of SSS17a
was covered by the large structure of ISS at the time of the trigger.  Because
of this, the SGM sensitivity should be worse than what we reported above.
Therefore, it is consistent that no signal of GRB 170817A is seen by the SGM data.

The CALET Calorimeter (CAL) was operating in the high energy trigger mode at the
trigger time of G298048.  However, no LVC high probability region was included
in the CAL's field of view at the time of the trigger.

SUBJECT: LIGO/Virgo G298048: Global properties and star-formation rate of NGC 4993
DATE:    17/08/22 16:55:17 GMT
FROM:    David Kaplan at UW-Milwaukee  <kaplan@uwm.edu>

E. M. Sadler (University of Sydney), J. R. Allison (University of Sydney), D. L. Kaplan (UWM), T. Murphy (University of Sydney) on behalf of the VAST collaboration.

The global properties of the candidate host galaxy NGC 4993 appear entirely consistent with those of a normal early-type galaxy, with a negligible level of ongoing star formation. 

An archival optical spectrum from the 6dF Galaxy Survey (6dFGS; Jones et al. 2009) is dominated by the light of an old stellar population along with weak H-alpha and [NII] emission lines. The relatively high [NII]/H-alpha emission-line ratio is suggestive of a low-ionisation AGN rather than star formation. The galaxy is devoid of any large neutral gas reservoir, with an upper limit to the neutral hydrogen mass of M_HI < 2e9 Msun (HIPASS; Meyer et al. 2004).

The 6dFGS fibre (6 arcsecond diameter) only covers the central region of the galaxy, and excludes the location of the putative optical counterpart, so it is still possible that star formation could be occurring outside the region covered by the 6dFGS spectrum. To check this, we looked at several photometric indicators of the current rate of massive star formation across the galaxy as a whole. 

We caution that all the values derived here should be considered as upper limits because of the possibility of contamination from a central AGN. From GALEX photometry (S_NUV ~ 1.08e-4 Jy) we obtain a near UV luminosity of L_NUV ~ 1.9e19 W/Hz. Using the relations from A. Hopkins (PhD thesis) and Cowie et al. (1997) gives an estimated NUV-derived star formation rate of SFR(NUV) ~ 0.003 Msun/yr for massive stars with M > 5 Msun. This low star formation rate is consistent with the global upper limit from far infrared photometry.  NGC 4993 is undetected by IRAS, so we adopt a conservative upper limit of 0.25 Jy for the FIR flux density at 60 microns. This gives a 60 micron luminosity L_FIR < 4.3e22 W/Hz. From Condon et al. (1992), this translates to a star formation rate (for stars more massive than 5 Msun) of SFR(FIR) < 0.08 Msun/yr. 

The existence of a low-luminosity radio-emitting active galactic nucleus in this galaxy is not surprising. The bivariate radio luminosity function of Mauch & Sadler (2007) implies that approximately 10% of galaxies of similar stellar mass to NGC 4993 host a radio AGN at least as strong as the central radio source reported for NGC 4993 (LVC GCNs 21537, 21548, and others), so the presence of this source is not unusual. The nuclear dust lanes evident in the HST ACS images (Foley et al. LVC GCN 21536) are similar to those seen in many other early-type galaxies, and may be the product of a minor merger than occurred as long as several Gyr ago.  

In summary, there is persuasive evidence that the current rate of massive-star formation in NGC 4993 is very low. We therefore speculate that the massive-star progenitors of the binary neutron-star system are likely to have formed and exploded several Gyr ago, implying a long in-spiral time for the neutron-star pair that produced the GW event.

We observed the field of the EM counterpart to the LVC trigger G298048 with
the Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO) starting on 2017-08-19T17:10:09UT  (PI
Fong).
We do not find evidence for significant X-ray emission at the location of
the optical transient (RA= 13:09:48.08, Dec= -23:22:53.2,  Coulter et al.
LVC GCN 21529; Allam et al., LVC GCN 21530; Sheng Yang et al., LVC GCN
21531; Chambers et al. LVC GCN 21553).

An extended X-ray source is clearly detected at:
RA= 13:09:47.7
dec= -23:23:02.0

This position is consistent with the radio source that we identified in
Alexander et al. (LVC GCN 21589) and it is centered on the host-galaxy
optical position. Based on preliminary analysis, we estimate a flux ~1e-14
erg/s/cm2 in the 0.3-10 keV band.

The CXO X-ray source lies outside the 90% containment, but within the
3-sigma containment, of the localization region of the Swift-XRT source
(Evans et al., LVC GCN 21612). The flux inferred by Evans et al., Fx=2.6
(+1.1, -0.9) e-14 erg/cm^2/s is also consistent with our results. We thus
suggest that the X-ray source identified by Swift-XRT is most likely
emission from the host galaxy.

We thank Belinda Wilkes and the entire Chandra team for their great support
with these observations.

We have initiated deep S band (2-4 GHz) observations of the potential 
host galaxies of the GW event G29048 from the CLU list (Cook et al. 
2017, LVC GCN 21535). The pointings, observed as part of the Jansky 
Array mapping of GW bursts as Afterglows in Radio (JAGWAR) program, have 
RMS noise between 10-20 uJy. The first observing epoch of NGC 4993 on 
2017 Aug 20.93 shows no radio source at the location of SSS17a (Coulter 
et al. 2017, LVC GCN 21529), with a 3sigma upper limit of ~40 uJy. We 
will report any radio transients found through the LVC GCN system.

Ogando et al. (2008) measured velocity dispersion and Lick indices for the
candidate host galaxy NGC 4993 using long-slit spectra obtained with the
1.52m ESO telescope. From their measurements of the central velocity
dispersion (163 km/s), we obtained the central black holes mass of
log(Mbh/Msun) ~ 7.7 using the relation given by Ferrarese & Merritt (2000).
We decomposed Pan-STARRS stacked r-band image of the galaxy using Galfit
(Peng et al. 2010). Our initial analysis obtained that the Sersic index n
=1.27. Using the Mbh-n relation (Savorgnan et al. 2013) gives a similar
estimation of the black hole mass log(Mbh/Msun) = 7.25. We also obtained the
effective radius Re = 2.8 kpc; the OT is located at ~2.2 kpc (0.78 Re) from
the nucleus.


We estimated the bolometric luminosity L_bol = 8.96e40 erg/s by adopting
Lx=5.6e39 erg/s (Evans et al. LVC GCN 21612) and using bolometric
correction Lbol/Lx = 16 for low-luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs; Ho 2008). We
obtained the Eddington luminosity L_Edd = 1.26e45.7 erg/s by using the Mbh
= 10e7.7 Msun given in this circular. This gives the Eddington ratio
L_bol/L_Edd = 7e(-5.7), which is similar to ratios of other LLAGNs (Ho
2008).


The galaxy has 18 companions, and it is considered to be located in medium
density regions (4 < N < 22) (Ogando et al. 2008). The galaxy mass
estimated by the effective radius and the central velocity dispersion
(Burstein et al.1997) is log(M*/Msun)=10.64, which is similar to the mean
value of the S0 sample of Ogando et al. (2008).


Our residual image of subtracting an IRAF elliptical model from the HST
archival ACS image  (F606W) shows clearly complicated dust lanes that are
extended from the nucleus to outer kpc regions, as mentioned in Foley et
al. (LVC GCN 21536). NGC 4993 could be a radio AGN (LVC GCN 21537, 21548,
21645). HST images show that some radio galaxies have optical jets (M87,
3C15, 3C78, 3C264). But no optical jets can be seen in our residual map of
NGC 4993.


In summary, the properties of the candidate host galaxy NGC 4993 seem to be
similar to normal early type galaxies, as indicated by Sadler et al. (LVC
GCN 21645).

from SSS17a at 8.5 and 10.5 GHz respectively.

Subsequent epochs are planned.

INTEGRAL is an observatory with multiple instruments: a gamma-ray
spectrometer (20 keV - 8 MeV, SPI), an imager (15 keV - 2 MeV, IBIS),
an X-ray monitor (3 - 25 keV, JEM-X), and an optical monitor (V band,
OMC). Our group requested and obtained follow-up observations of the
LIGO/Virgo candidate NS merger G298048 (GCN 21505, 21506).

The initial observation was centered on the best Fermi/GBM
localization, RA=176.8, Dec=-39.8 (GCN 21509), and was carried out
from 2017-08-18 08:17:51 to 2017-08-18 12:36:11 for a total observing
time of 14.8 ks. It covered 72% of the Fermi/GBM localization
probability but only a negligible fraction of the current LIGO/Virgo
localization. We do not detect any new sources in the complete
IBIS/ISGRI (20-80 keV and 80 - 300 keV) and JEM-X (3-10 keV, 10 - 25
keV) mosaicked images, with a best sensitivity of 7.9 mCrab (1.2e-7
erg/cm2/s) in the 20 - 80 keV energy range.

The main part of the INTEGRAL follow-up observation was centered on
the candidate optical counterpart SSS17a (RA=13:09:48.089
Dec=-23:22:53.35; GCN 21529).  This observation spanned from
2017-08-18 12:45:10 to 2017-08-23 04:07:47 (starting about 24 hours
after the LIGO/Virgo event), with a maximum on-source time of about
330 ks (depending on the instrument).

SSS17a was in IBIS and SPI FoV in each of the dithered single pointing
that make up an INTEGRAL observations; whilst it was in the JEM-X FoV
only a fraction of the time.

We investigated the complete observation mosaics of ISGRI, SPI, and
JEM-X data. INTEGRAL provides the most stringent constraint on any
possible emission associated with SSS17a above 80 keV. We do not
detect the source in any energy ranges of any of the INTEGRAL
instruments, and set the following 3-sigma upper bounds for an average
flux of a source at the position of SSS17a:

JEM-X:

3-10 keV:       1.2 mCrab (1.9e-11 erg/cm2/s )
10-25 keV:      0.64 mCrab (7e-12 erg/cm2/s )

ISGRI:

20-80 keV:      2.6 mCrab (3.8e-11 erg/cm2/s)
80-300 keV:     6.2 mCrab (7.1e-11 erg/cm2/s)
300-500 keV:    291.6 mCrab (1e-9 erg/cm2/s)

SPI:

20 - 80 keV:    7.2 mCrab (1.1e-10 erg/cm2/s)
80 - 300 keV:   24 mCrab (2.8e-10 erg/cm2/s)
300 - 500 keV:  175 mCrab (6.1e-10 erg/cm2/s)
500 - 1000 keV: 770 mCrab (3.1e-9 erg/cm2/s)
1 MeV - 2 MeV:  1.0 Crab (3.3e-9 erg/cm2/s)

We have also searched for isolated line-like features in ISGRI and SPI
data, and preliminary analysis did not identify any such
features. Further analysis is ongoing.

IBIS, SPI, and JEM-X observed more than 97% of the of LIGO
localization in the combined observation mosaic.  We searched
IBIS/ISGRI and JEM-X data for any new point source in the whole 90%
LIGO/Virgo localization region, and did not find any. The sensitivity
depends on the location, with the best value close to that computed
for SSS17a.

Continuous observation provided by INTEGRAL allows us to perform an
exhaustive search for any short (magnetar-like) or long bursts from
SSS17a. We build IBIS/ISGRI light-curves in 2 energy ranges: 20-80 keV,
80-300 keV, on 100 ms, 1 s, 10 s, and 100 s time scales. The
lightcurves span from 2017-08-18T12:45:10 to 2017-08-23T04:07:47 with
a coverage fraction of 80%. We did not find any deviations from the
background, and set a 3-sigma upper limit on any possible 1-s long
burst flux of 1.0 Crab (1.4e-8 erg/cm2/s) in 20-80 keV, and 6.8 Crab
(7.8e-8 erg/cm2/s) in 80-300 keV.

We also inspected the JEM-X (3-25 keV) light curves at 10 s time
scale, and did not find any significant fluctuations apart from
sporadic particle contaminations). The corresponding upper limit in
3-25 keV is 0.4 Crab (1.3e-8 erg/cm2/s).

Analysis of the PICsIT spectral-timing data with 100 s time resolution
in four energy bands spanning 208-2600 keV did not reveal any
significant variability associated with SSS17a during revolutions 1852
and 1853.

During these observation INTEGRAL/IBAS system identified two weak
triggers (at 2017-08-22 21:05:59 and 2017-08-22 05:48:21). The
localization of these events is not compatible with SSS17a. We
consider these events to be noise associated with moderate solar
activity.

Unfortunately, the optical camera on-board INTEGRAL, OMC, was unable to
disentangle SSS17a from the host galaxy NGC4993.

We acknowledge the exceptionally efficient support by the teams at
ESAC and ESOC for the scheduling of this follow-up observation.

The H.E.S.S. array of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes was used to carry out follow-up observations of the GW trigger G298048 (GCN #21509) and monitoring of the possible counterpart SSS17a/DLT17ck (Coulter et al. GCN #21529; Yang et al., GCN #21531).
H.E.S.S. observations started August 17 at 18:00 UTC with three pointings derived from the HLV-Bayestar map (GCN #21513) without assumptions on the orientation of the system and cross correlated in three dimensions with the GLADE catalog [1]. The first of these pointings covered the region of NGC 4993 and the potential EM counterpart SSS17a/DLT17ck. We continued to monitor the region around SSS17a/DLT17ck during the following nights until the location moved outside the H.E.S.S. visiblity window. The last pointing was taken August 22, 18:00 UTC.
Each of our observations has a sensitivity of about 20% of the flux from the Crab nebula at 5 sigma. A preliminary analysis with an energy threshold of about 500GeV did not reveal significant gamma-ray emission in any of the datasets. Further analyses of the data are on-going.

H.E.S.S. is an array of five imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes for the detection of very-high-energy gamma-ray sources and is located in the Khomas Highlands in Namibia. It was constructed and is operated by researchers from Armenia, Australia, Austria, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Japan, Poland, South Africa, Sweden, UK, and the host country, Namibia.

On 2017 August 22, we conducted a LOFAR follow-up observation of the Advanced LIGO/Virgo trigger G298048 with the ILT (International Low-Frequency Array [LOFAR] Telescope). This is a highly experimental observation to assess whether images of sufficient quality can be obtained at very low elevations. The observation began at 14:05:00 UTC, near transit, with any useable data likely only within the first hour. We placed two beams on the most northerly part of the probability distribution, as determined from the preliminary LALInference map. The bandwidth for each beam is 47.5 MHz, spread over the frequency range 120-187 MHz. The beam centres (RA/Dec), in degrees, are as follows:

1) 192.4167   -15.8333
2) 193.1875   -17.0000

where the field of view per beam is 11.35 deg^2 at 150 MHz. Analysis is ongoing, with the possibility of further observations if this test run is deemed to have been successful.  
  
We thank the ASTRON Radio Observatory for rapidly scheduling the observations.

The Long Wavelength Array (LWA1, located west of Socorro, New Mexico)
[S.W. Ellingson, et al. http://lanl.arxiv.org/abs/1204.4816] made
observations on June 17 following the LIGO trigger G298048. The first
observation began at 2017-08-17 13:09:51 UTC (28 minutes after the
trigger) and ran for approximately 1.1 hours.

All observations were centered at frequencies 25.85 MHz and 45.45 MHz,
each with a bandwidth of 19.6 MHz. The FWHM is 15.499 degrees at 25.85
MHz, and 6.648 degrees at 45.45 MHz.

The beam centers for the first observation were: Beam 1: RA 2.391h, Dec
41.810deg; Beam 2: RA 2.431h, Dec 46.572deg; Beam 3: RA 2.803h, Dec
44.202deg; and Beam 4: RA 2.660h, Dec 50.480deg. These were chosen to
observe the maximum of the LIGO skymap available with the initial
notice.

The next observation, using an updated skymap, began at 2017-08-17
19:15:00 UTC (6.6 hours after the trigger) and ran for 4 hours.

The beam centers for the second observation were Beam 1: RA 12.814h, Dec
-13.862deg; Beam 2: RA 12.955h, Dec -17.896deg; Beam 3: RA 13.096h, Dec
-22.024deg; and Beam 4: RA 11.786h, Dec -39.840deg. These coordinates
include the position of the observed transient, as reported by D.A.
Coulter, et al., [GCN 21529], as well as nearby regions.

We plan to continue follow-up observations at the second set of
coordinates over the next few weeks. Data analysis is proceeding.

A.J. Levan, J.D. Lyman, D.T.H. Steeghs (U. Warwick), N.R. Tanvir (U. Leicester), J. Hjorth (Dark Cosmology Centre) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed the candidate counterpart and host galaxy (NGC 4993) of LIGO/Virgo G298048 (LSC GCN 21509) with the ESO VLT and the MUSE Integral Field Unit, starting at 2018 August 18.99. MUSE has a 1â€™ field of view, and a spectral range from 4650-9300A. Both the host galaxy and transient are clearly visible. The bulk spectrum of the transient is comparable to others reported at the same epoch (Lyman et al. GCN 21582, Nicholl et al. GCN 21585, Dâ€™Elia et al. GCN 21592).

The galaxy is dominated by a spheroidal component, but weak spiral arms can be seen in emission lines extending both north and south from the centre of the galaxy. They do not reach the location of the transient, and no underlying star formation in the form of emission lines is evident in the vicinity of the transient source. Further analysis is ongoing.

We thank the staff at Paranal for their excellent assistance in performing the observations."

 I. Martinez-Castellanos (University of Maryland, College Park) and
A.J. Smith (University of Maryland, College Park) on behalf of the
HAWC Collaboration:

HAWC Collaboration performed a follow-up of LIGO trigger G298048. At the
time of the trigger no portion of the LV contour was visible to HAWC, so
no prompt follow-up was possible.

About 9hrs after the trigger the LV region transited through the HAWC FOV
(95% of the probability was covered), albeit with a large zenith angle,
which limits the sensitivity of our observations. There were no >5 sigma
points observed during this transit. For a single transit, the 5 sigma
sensitivity to a power law spectrum with a -2.5 index ranges from
~2e-11 >1TeV cm^-2 s^-1 (~3 Crab units) at dec=-12 to about 6 times higher
at the edge of our FOV, dec=-25.

At the point of the optical counterpart candidate SSS17a/DLT17ck
(RA=13:09:48.09 DEC=-23:22:53.35) reported by Coulter et al. (LVC GCN
21529), Allam et al. (LVC GCN 21530), Yang et al. (LVC GCN 21531),
Melandri et al. (LVC GCN 21532), we obtain an 95% confidence level upper
limit for >1TeV assuming a -2.5 spectrum of 1.0e-10 cm^-2 s^-1. These
observations were made on 2017-08-17 between 19:57 UT and 23:25 UT with
culmination 9:00 hrs after the LV trigger.

HAWC is a TeV gamma ray water Cherenkov array located in the state of
Puebla, Mexico. It is sensitive to the energy range ~0.5-100TeV, and
monitors 2/3 of the sky every day with an instantaneous field-of-view of
~2 sr.

R. Chornock (Ohio University) and E. Berger (Harvard) report on behalf of a

Further to our previous report (LVC GCN 21638), we have continued near-infrared 
observations of the optical counterpart (Coulter et al., LVC GCN 21529; Allam et 
al., LVC GCN 21530; Yang et al., LVC GCN 21531) to the LIGO/Virgo source G298048 
(GCNs 21509, 21513) using FLAMINGOS2 on Gemini-South (PI: Chornock).

Over the course of our initial observations, obtained during the first 4.5 days 
after the GW trigger, the H-band flux from the near-infrared source was not 
strongly variable.  However, in H-band acquisition images obtained tonight 
(20170824 at 23:47 UT, t~7.5 d after the GW trigger), the NIR counterpart 
appears substantially fainter (by >1 magnitude) compared to our previous 
observations three nights earlier.  A phase of more rapid NIR fading may have begun.

Chavez, P. Candia, and the director, Laura Ferrarese, for their support of these

LIGO/Virgo GW trigger G298048
(GCN #21505 and #21509 ,T0=2017-08-17 at 12:41:04.527 UTC)

We searched for Ultra-High-Energy (UHE) neutrinos with energies
above ~ 1e17 eV in data collected with the Surface Detector (SD)
of the Pierre Auger Observatory in a [-500,500] second interval
about the LIGO-Virgo trigger G298048 as well as 1 day after it.

The field of view (fov) where the SD of Auger is sensitive to UHE
neutrinos (corresponding to inclined directions with respect to the
vertical relative to the ground) was FULLY COINCIDENT with the
LIGO+Virgo 90% localization region (GCN #21513 bayestar-HLV.fits.gz)
at the time T0 of the merger alert as well as with the optical
counterpart detected by the Swope telescope (GCN #21529).
Also the 90% CL Fermi GBM trigger 170817.529 contour (GCN #21506)
at the trigger time was largely overlapping with the Auger fov.

NO events survived the cuts applied to reject the background due
to UHE Cosmic Rays i.e. NO neutrino candidates were detected.

MASTER Global Robotic Net (http:/ / observ.pereplet.ru/ ) consists of a 
new generation of fast robotic telescopes that
installed on different continents during recent years.

MASTER-II are twin 40 cm wide field (2x4 square degrees, 1 pixel = 2.0 
arcsec) optical robotic telescopes located in the following observatories:
MASTER-Amur (far east of Russia, Blagoveshchensk), MASTER-Tunka (Russia, 
Baykal lake), MASTER-Kislovodsk, MASTER-Tavrida (Russia), MASTER-SAAO (South Africa), 
MASTER-IAC (Spain, Canarias), and MASTER-OAFA (Argentina, MASTER I yet).

MASTER observatories are equipped with their own identical photometers and 
are controlled by identical software (Lipunov et al., "MASTER Global 
Robotic Net",  Advances in Astronomy, 2010, 30L).

  The identical equipment gives us the possibility of having up to  24 
continuous hours observations of optical counterparts of GRBs in identical
photometric systems. Therefore, combining photometric data for different 
GRBs observed from different parts of the MASTER Net is a well-justified 
astronomical process (see last result in Troya, Lipunov, Mundel  et al., 
Nature, 2017, vol.547,425-427)

Taking into account the large field of view of the MASTER II telescopes (8 
square degrees), we can use a large number (1000 - 5,000)
of reference stars for reduction. As a result, the photometric errors of 
large catalogs, Tycho II and   USNO-B1, shouldbe leveled out.

Global MASTER-Net started to observe LIGO/Virgo G298048 error field at 
2017-08-17 17:06:47 UT.

MASTER-SAAO (MASTER II robotic telescope at South Africa Astronomical 
Observatory, Sutherland) automaticaly have imaged the initial BAYESTAR error 
field received by socket connection (LVC GCN 21505) including
common region with Fermi GBM error box  (Connaughton  et al., LVC GCN 21506) 
immediatelly after sunset  at 2017-08-17 17:06:47 = 2017-08-17.71304 (JD = 
2457983.21304398) i.e. 15943 sec after LVC trigger time (12:41:04 UT) .
 	The coaadded (3x180sec) first   unfiltered images limit is 19.8. This 
image  included ICECube candidate N4   (Bartos et al  LVC GCN 21511). No OTs 
found  in this error box.

After that MASTER-SAAO telescope continue to image Fermi and LVC initial common 
error field and all Ice Cube candidates. The unfiltered limits and fields 
one can find at GraceDB. Cover map is available at
http://master.sai.msu.ru/static//ligo/db/G298048/151A//img/MASTER.G298048.180.24.gif

No OTs found at this observations.
The Possible KiloNova SSS17a in NGC 4993 (Coulter et al., LVC GCN 21529) 
is  not covering by MASTER-SAAO at 17 Aug 2017.

MASTER-OAFA  (MASTER I robotic telescope with FOV = 6 square degrees;  at Argentina, Observatorio Astronomico Felix Aguilar 
(OAFA), National University of San Juan,) have imaged the new BAYESTAR-HLV
localization map of  LIGO/Virgo  G298048 (GCN 21513) starting
2017-08-17 22:54:18 =  2017-08-17.954375 from  first field (6 square degrees):

RA, DEC  = 12h 59m 00.00s -19d 59m 38.00s

Unforunatelly the first telescope image not include sss17a.

But fortunally 
there are two MASTER Very Wide Field cameras (FOV = 2x380 square degrees, 
22 arcsec in pixel, see Lipunov et al.,  2010, MASTER Robotic Net, 
Advances in Astronomy, vol. 2010, pp. 1-7)  at same mount.
As the results we have large seria ("video") MASTER VWF cameras images 
exposition and without time gap of the all LIGO/Virgo G298048 error box include 
the NGC 4993 galaxy. We see NGC 4993 galaxy on coadded images. After the 
images substraction with refernce very wide field camera images we see 
some excess (see Table 1) at NGC 4993 position with flux corresponded to ~15.3 
mag.

Starting from 2017-08-17 22:58:48 UT = 2017-08-17 22:58:48 MASTER-OAFA have 
imaged  new BAYESTAR-HLV localization map of  LIGO/Virgo  G298048 (GCN 21513) 
with unfiltered images (150 sec exposition) limit 19-20 magnitudes. The coadded 
images limit grows to 20.5.

At 2017-08-17 23:59:54 UT   i.e. 11 h 18m 50 sec after LVC trigger time 
MASTER-OAFA robotic telescope independently from any optical 
information take second image with NGC 
4993 galaxy where Possible KiloNova SSS17a was published late

merging ~ 40 Mpc is in good agreement with predicted merging rate inside local 
super cluster (Lipunov, Postnov & Prokhorov, 1987, A&A, vol.176, L1-L4.). See 
fig. 1 which is vailable at http://master.sai.msu.ru/static/LPP1987_fig1.jpg .

There was predicted 1 merging NS+NS per year for 20 Mpc radius volume(e-case, 
see capture). This means, that for 40 Mpc  predicted ~ 10 per year!

INTEGRAL is an observatory with multiple instruments: a gamma-ray
spectrometer (20 keV -4 MeV, SPI), an imager (15 keV - 2 MeV, IBIS),
an X-ray monitor (3-25 keV, JEM-X), and an optical monitor (V band,
OMC). Our group requested and obtained pointed follow-up observations
of the LIGO/Virgo candidate BBH merger G297595 (GCN 21474).

The INTEGRAL follow-up observation was centered on RA=41.07
Dec=-45.49, close to the peak of the LIGO/Virgo localization
probability, taking into account observational constrains. This
observation spanned from 2017-08-16 at 10:04 to 2017-08-17 at 18:19
(starting about 47 hours after the LIGO/Virgo event), with a maximum
on-source time of 97.5 ks (depending on the instrument).

IBIS and SPI observed more than 92% of the of LIGO/Virgo localization
in the combined observation mosaic. JEM-X covered about 79%, owing to
its smaller Field of View.  INTEGRAL provides the most stringent
constraint on any possible emission associated with G297595, above 80
keV.  We searched IBIS/ISGRI and JEM-X data for new point sources in
the whole 90% LIGO/Virgo localization region, and did not find any. We
set the following 3-sigma upper limits for the average flux:

JEM-X:

3-10 keV: 2.0 mCrab (3.2e-11  erg/cm2/s )
10-25 keV: 1.0 mCrab (1.1e-11  erg/cm2/s )

ISGRI:

20-80 keV: 3.3 mCrab (4.9e-11 erg/cm2/s)
80-300 keV: 13.1 mCrab (1.5e-10 erg/cm2/s)


In the case of ISGRI (JEM-X), 82% (59%) of the of LIGO/Virgo
localization is covered with sensitivity no more than factor two worse
than the best.

During these observation online INTEGRAL/IBAS system identified
several weak triggers. After offline inspection, we consider these
triggers unrelated noise.

INTEGRAL/IBAS online search in the SPI-ACS identified a bright
GRB170816A on 2017-08-16 at 14:22:58. The location of this GRB is
inconsistent with the LIGO/Virgo 90% localization (GCN 21504, 21517).

Finally, the BNS merger G298048 (GCN 21509, 21513) candidate
counterpart (GRB 170817A, GCN 21506, 21520) was detected in the
INTEGRAL data during this observation, as reported in GCN 21507.

We have also inspected PICsIT spectral-timing data (200 - 2600 keV)
and did not find any evidence for significant variability.

Further analysis is ongoing.

We acknowledge the essential support by the teams at ESAC and ESOC for
the scheduling of this follow-up observation.

We report on continued follow-up observations of SSS17a (GCN 21529; Coulter
et al.) with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) following
the first epoch at 610 MHz (GCN 21603; De et al.). Observations were
carried out on UT 20 August 2017 08:00 at 400 MHz (200 MHz bandwidth) for
an on-source time of ~ 1 hour and on UT 20 August 2017 11:00 at 1.4 GHz
(400 MHz bandwidth) for an on-source time of ~ 2 hours.

After a preliminary analysis, no emission is detected at the location of
the optical transient at 1.4 GHz up to a 3 sigma upper limit of 100
microJy. The transient was also undetected at 400 MHz, although this
observation was partially affected by RFI and the analysis is being
improved. Further multi-frequency observations are planned.

We thank the GMRT staff for prompt scheduling of these observations. The
GMRT is run by the National Center for Radio Astrophysics of the Tata
Institute of Fundamental Research.

Following Lynch et al. (LVC GCN 21670), we observed a third epoch of
NGC 4993 with the Australia Telescope Compact Array at 8.5 and 10.5 GHz.
Observations started at 2017-08-27 23:26:24.9 UT and ended at
2017-08-28 9:00:00 UT with approximately 2.3 hours of on-source time.

We fit and subtracted a point-source at the optical position of NGC 4993
(13:09:47.71, -23:23:01.79; Skrutskie et al. 2003, 2MASS Extended Source
Catalog). From this we set a 3-sigma upper limit of 54 uJy and 39 uJy on
radio emission from SSS17a at 8.5 and 10.5 GHz respectively.

Subsequent epochs are planned.

Thank you to CSIRO staff for supporting these observations.

We report 7 days of Zadko Telescope imaging of the transient SSS17a/DLT17ck in NGC4339 started on 2017-08-19 10:57 UT (t0+2 days).

We use the stacked image of the night 201-08-26 (t0+9 days) as a mask to substract the light contribution from the galaxy NGC 4993 and synthesise one residual image for each nights observation. Photometry is performed using the star NOMAD-1 0666-0296321 for PSF fitting.

The complete log of Zadko image analysis from t0+2 â€“ t0+9 is:

Tstart 	Tend 	r(AB) 	1sigma
1.928 	1.930 	18.46 	0.17
2.929 	2.950 	19.18 	0.12

6.958 	6.978 	>20.6
7.955 	7.976 	>20.6

Observations are compatible with a power law decay (alpha=-2) or with a exponential decay with a half time of 1.25 days.

The Zadko Telescope is operated by the University of Western Australia (UWA), and was made possible by a philanthropic donation by James Zadko, to UWA.

on behalf of the Konus-Wind team, report:

Konus-Wind (KW) was observing the whole sky at the time of the 
LIGO/Virgo event G298048 (2017-08-17 12:41:04.446 UTC, hereafter T0; 
LIGO/Virgo Collaboration GCN Circ. 21509) coincident with Fermi GBM 
trigger 524666471 (Connaughton et al., GCN Circ. 21506, Goldstein et 
al., GCN Circ. 21528).

Using waiting-mode data within the interval T0 +/- 100 s,
we found no significant (> 4 sigma) excess over the background
in both KW detectors on temporal scales from 2.944 s to 100 s.

For the 2.944 s interval containing GBM trigger and the 
highest-probability localization region for the LIGO/Virgo G298048 (LVC, 
GCN Circ. 21513) we estimate an upper limit (90% conf.) on the 10 keV â€“ 
10 MeV fluence to 3.0x10^-7 erg/cm^2 for a burst lasting less than 2.944 
s and having the spectrum reported by Goldstein et al. (an exponentially 
cut off power law, CPL, with alpha=-0.9 and Ep=128 keV).
For a typical short GRB spectrum (CPL with alpha=-0.5 and Ep=500 keV), 
the limiting fluence is 6.9x10^-7 erg/cm^2 (10 keV â€“ 10 MeV).

All the quoted values are preliminary.

We observed the position of the optical counterpart SSS17a (Coulter et al., LVC 21529) with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
(ALMA) on 2017 August 19 UT and 2017 August 26 UT. Each observation
lasted 20 minutes and was performed using ALMA's Band 3, with spectral
windows of 4 GHz bandwidth centered at 91.5 and 103.5 GHz. 

We have analyzed the data using a custom CASA-based pipeline. At a mean
frequency of 97.5 GHz, we detect no emission at the location of the
optical transient to a combined 3-sigma limit of 50 microJy. We detect
a source with a preliminary flux density of ~0.2 mJy at the location:

RA = 13:09:47.696
dec = -23:23:02.31

with a positional uncertainty of ~0.04 arcsec. This is consistent with
the optical position of the host galaxy and the position of the radio
source reported by Alexander et al. (LVC 21545) and others.

We thank the ALMA staff, especially Tony Remijan, for their excellent

2017-08-23T21:18:44 to 2017-08-24T00:10:30

On-off measurements of about 32s on-source integration were inerleaved with
calibration observations, for a cadence of roughly 15 measurements per hour.

In both periods there was no signal above our 3-sigma detection limit ~ 50
mJy in any individual on-off measurement.

Further observations are planned, along with improved analysis to refine

FROM:    Eleonora Troja at GSFC/Swift  <nora.gsfc@gmail.com>

E. Troja (UMD/GSFC), L. Piro (INAF/IAPS), T. Sakamoto (AGU),
S. B. Cenko (NASA/GSFC), and A. Lien (UMBC/GSFC) report on behalf
of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of SSS17a (Coulter et al., LVC GCN 21529) with
the Chandra X-ray Observatory under our approved guest observer program
(18500489; PI: E. Troja). Observations were carried out on 2017-08-26
(~9 days after the LVC trigger) for a total exposure of 50 ks.

We detect the extended X-ray source visible in previous observations
(Evans et al., LVC GCN 21612; Margutti et al., LVC GCN 21648) at a
comparable flux level. In addition, we detect an X-ray source at the
optical/IR transient position, approximately 10 arcsecond from the
centroid of the extended X-ray emission. The probability to find an
unrelated X-ray source within the small localization of the optical
transient is negligible (<1E-5).

Previous candidate kilonovae (e.g. GRB080513, Perley et al. 2009;
GRB130603B; Tanvir et al. 2013) were associated to transient X-ray
emission, although bright X-rays are not a basic prediction of this
model. In our case, the properties of the X-ray emission and the
overall spectral energy distribution appear different.
The most likely explanation seems that the observed X-rays arise from
the afterglow of GRB170817A (Connaughton et al., LVC GCN 21506;
Savchenko et al., LVC GCN 21507), thus confirming the spatial
association between the short GRB and SSS17a.

A newborn spinning-down magnetar could power a long-lived and nearly
constant X-ray emission (Zhang & Meszaros, 2001). However,
the observed timescale and X-ray luminosity would imply unrealistic
values of the initial spin period and magnetic field. The previous
lack of detection from Chandra (Margutti et al., LVC GCN 21648)
further disfavors this magnetar model. Other models (e.g. Metzger
& Piro, 2014) also do not match our observed luminosities and timescales.

For a standard on-axis afterglow, the extrapolation of the observed
flux would violate the upper limits reported by Evans et al.
(LVC GCN 21550), and Cenko et al. (LVC GCN 21572).

Our observations are instead consistent with the onset of an off-axis
afterglow from the GRB jet. This would explain the low luminosity of
the observed gamma-ray emission, and the lack of early afterglow
detections.

Further observations are planned.

We thank Belinda Wilkes and the entire CXC staff for rapidly scheduling
these observations.

L. Resmi (IIST),  K. Misra (ARIES),  N. R. Tanvir (U. Leicester), P. T. O’Brien (U. Leicester) and S. Schulze (Weizmann Institute of Science) report on behalf of a larger collaboration.

We observed the LIGO/Virgo G298048 source SSS17a (Coulter et al. LVC GCN Circ. 21529) with the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) on 25 Aug 2017 10.5 UT at 1390 MHz for a total integration time of 2 hours.  
 
Preliminary analysis of the data does not reveal any emission at the location of the optical transient up to a 3-sigma upper limit of 130 micro Jy. 
 
We report a weak detection of ~ 160 micro Jy at

RA(2000) = 13:09:47.74
Dec(2000) = -23:23:01.24  with a positional uncertainty of 3".   
This is consistent with the position of the optical host galaxy and the JVLA/ALMA radio source reported by Alexander et al. (LVC GCN Circ 21589) and Williams et al (LVC GCN Circ 21750). 

Further analysis is underway. Continued follow-up observations are planned.

We thank the GMRT staff for prompt scheduling of these observations. The GMRT is run by the National Center for Radio Astrophysics of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research.

We continued optical and near-infrared observations of SSS17a (Coulter et
al., LVC GCN 21529). The source appears substantially fainter than
in our previous observations ( Troja et al., LVC GCN 21682),
consistent with the rapid NIR fading reported by Chornock & Berger
(LVC GCN 21684).  However, over the course of the last three nights,
the NIR countepart appears to have flattened inthe Ks-band at
a level of ~17.7 mag.

between 22 and 28 August (under programmes GO 14804 (Levan), 
GO 14850 (Troja) and GO 14771 (Tanvir)). The transient is well 
detected in both the nIR and optical imaging, but is fading rapidly at the 
end of the observations, with a factor two fading between Aug 26 
and Aug 28 in the F160W filter.

Spectroscopy at the first epoch covers the range 0.9-1.6 microns,
and the counterpart is well detected across this spectral range.
The spectrum is dominated by a range of broad features, most notably
a peak at ~1.1 microns, but additional features are observed between
1.2 and 1.6 microns.

Pi of the Sky telescope surveyed area (RA: 220 - 22 deg, DEC: -10 - 70) that overlap, in parts, with initial bayesstar skymap for G298048. Observations were conducted from INTA, Huelva Spain during nights 17th up to 21th of August. Is it worth noting that this area was well observed from 10th up 16th August giving a strong reference background.


Data was searched for any type of transients connected with objects from GLADE catalogue. Data analysis showed that it is unlikely to have an slowly fading optical transient. However two possible fast fading optical transients are still under investigations along with several other subprimes.


Investigated possible optical transients with positions:

RA                  DEC

20.876109    33.322977
354.050166  14.997596


We have performed our observations using two cameras using only IR-cut filter. Each camera have 20 by 20 degree field of view. For each observed field (20 by 20 degrees), the telescope has made five 10 s exposures twice a night. Observations have limiting brightness between 11.5 - 12 mag.

with the optical/IR transient SSS17a (Coulter et al., LVC GCN 21529) possibly
associated with GW170817A.

GRID data analysis covering the SSS17a position was performed in the energy
range 50 MeV - 10 GeV with integration times from 1 to 3 days centered at T0+9
days. Preliminary values of 2-sigma upper limits (UL) are reported below:

3.0e-10 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for a 1-day integration time
(from 26 August 00:00 UT to 27 August 00:00 UT);

We report a new ~47 ks Chandra X-ray observation (ObsID 18988, PI Haggard) of the LVC trigger G298048, a.k.a. GW170817, beginning 2017 September 02, approximately 16 days after the trigger. These observations include the optical transient SSS17a (Coulter et al., LVC GCN 21529) and the Swift area of interest (Evans et al., LVC GCN 21612).

We detect X-ray emission from two point sources and from one extended source: (i) point-source X-ray emission at the location of the optical transient SSS17a (Coulter et al., LVC GCN 21529; Troja et al., LVC GCN 21765; Margutti LVC GCN 21786; Troja et al., LVC GCN 21787), (ii) another point source at the location of the Swift X-ray emission (Evans et al., LVC GCN 21612) also reported by Margutti et al. (LVC GCN 21786), and (iii) extended emission from the host galaxy NGC 4993 (Evans et al., LVC GCN 21612; Margutti et al., LVC GCN 21648).

We analyze these new data in combination with DDT Chandra observations acquired one day earlier (ObsID 20728, PI Troja) and report tentative evidence for decreasing fluxes from both X-ray point sources (1-sigma errors are ~1E-15 erg/s/cm2):

We monitored the field around the optical counterpart SSS17a (Coulter
et al., LVC 21529) with the e-MERLIN radio interferometer between
August 23 and 28, 2017. We conducted observations at C band centred at
5 GHz with a bandwidth of 512 MHz for 5 hours between 13:00 and 18:00
UTC in each consecutive day.

No significant detection above 5-sigma level is found in the runs with
individual rms noise levels between 31 and 39 microJy/beam. The upper
limits at 5-sigma level are 180, 160, 160, 190, 150, 150 microJy/beam
for days 23 to 28 August, respectively. The average half power beam
width of the images is 266 mas x 33 mas with a position angle of 0
degrees. An image produced combining the data from the six runs yields
an upper limit of 70 microJy/beam at the 5-sigma level.

Additional observations are planned with e-MERLIN to continue the
monitoring of the transient source.

e-MERLIN is a National Facility operated by the University of
Manchester at Jodrell Bank Observatory on behalf of STFC.

report on behalf of a larger GROWTH (Global Relay of Observatories Watching
Transients Happen) collaboration

We registered our HST F336W image (PI Kasliwal) with the Gaia astrometric
catalog to derive a more precise position of SSS17a (Coulter et al. LVC GCN
21529). We find a position of 13:09:48.071 -23:22:53.37 with astrometric
residuals of 0.05". This new position is consistent with the position of
the radio source reported in companion GCNs by Corsi et al. LVC GCN 21815
and Mooley et al. LVC GCN 21814.

Observations of 1 square degrees of the skymap of the Advanced LIGO
and Virgo trigger G298048 (LVC GCN Circ. 21509, 21513) were performed with
the VLT Survey Telescope (VST - Proposal ID ESO 099.D-0191) at ESO-Paranal
equipped with OMEGACAM. The observations are centered on the galaxy
NGC4993.  The images were taken in the i_SDSS filter with a total exposure
of 1200s. The observations started at 2017-08-31T 23:22:12.442 UTC and
finished at 2017-08-31T 23:39:26.585. The Optical Transient (OT) is not
visibile in the coadded image. The completeness at 50% for point-like
sources is 22.53 AB mag.  Automatic data reduction with the VSTTube
pipeline (Grado et al. 2012 Mem.SAIt 19, 362 ) was completed.
We acknowledge excellent support from the ESO User Support Department and
from ESO observing staff in Paranal.

Following the reported VLA detection of a radio source (Mooley et al.;
LVC GCN 21814, Corsi et al.; LVC GCN 21815) coincident with the optical
transient SSS17a (Coulter et al. LVC GCN 21529) we conducted further
observations of NGC 4993 with the Australia Telescope Compact Array at
5.5 and 9 GHz. Observations started at 2017-09-04 22:43:04 UT and ended
at 2017-09-05 10:03:04 UT with approximately 9.5 hours of on-source time.

We did not make a robust detection, although there is marginal emission
at the 4-sigma level, at a position consistent with that reported by
Mooley at al. and Corsi et al. This could be associated with the host
galaxy or the optical transient.

Analysis is ongoing, and subsequent epochs are planned.

Thank you to CSIRO staff for supporting these observations.

We report the preliminary detection of a radio source in a beam centered
on RA 13.096h, Dec -22.024deg, the LIGO/Virgo G298048 event coordinates,
during a four-hour observation on August 17 (19:15 UTC, 6.6 hours after
the GW trigger), using station 1 of the Long Wavelength Array (LWA1)
[GCN 21680]. Simultaneous ON-OFF observations were taken at 25 MHz and
45 MHz, and follow-up observations were taken August 24 (19:50 UTC), one
week after the initial observations. Comparison of the ON-OFF
observations for the two epochs indicate the apparent presence of a ~20
Jy source, at 25 MHz, in the beam on RA 13.096h, Dec -22.024deg. There
is no difference between the ON-OFF results at 45 MHz, for the two
epochs. Further analysis and follow up observations are underway.

Radio observations with the Very Long Baseline Array from 2.5 weeks ago (Deller et al., LVC GCN 21588) covering the field surrounding the optical transient SSS17a/DLT17ck (e.g., Coulter et al., LVC GCN 21529; Allam et al., LVC GCN 21530; Yang et al., LVC GCN 21531) have now been correlated and analysed.  

Each observation spanned 6.5 hours, with 256 MHz of bandwidth (dual polarisation) centered on 8.7 GHz, giving an image rms of approximately 22 microJy.  A 12500x12500 pixel image (2.5 x 2.5") image was produced, centered on SSS17a/DLT17ck.  As expected given non-detections with the VLA (Alexander at al., LVC GCN  21589; Corsi et al.,  LVC GCN 21613; Corsi et al., LVC GCN 21614; Corsi et al., LVC GCN  21636) and ATCA (Bannister at al., LVC GCN 21559; Kaplan et al., LVC GCN 21574; Lynch et al.,  LVC GCN 21670) close in time to these VLBA observations, we do not detect any radio emission, and place 5.5 sigma upper limits as follows:

Observation center MJD 57985.9: 5.5 sigma upper limit 125 microJy.
Observation center MJD 57986.9: 5.5 sigma upper limit 120 microJy.

Combining these two observations places a deeper limit, with image rms 16 microJy: 5.5 sigma upper limit 88 microJy.

We thank the staff of the Long Baseline Observatory for supporting these observations.

K. D. Alexander, E. Berger, T. Eftekhari, W. Fong, and R. Margutti report
on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the location of the optical counterpart of LIGO/Virgo
G298048 (Coulter
et al. LVC GCN 21529; Allam et al. LVC GCN 21530) with the Very Large Array
at a frequency of 6 GHz (C-band) on September 5.925 UT.  We do not detect
any significant radio emission (S/N>3) and therefore cannot confirm the
radio detection reported two days earlier by Corsi et al. (LVC GCN
21815) for a comparable integration time on source and at the same
frequency.  This indicates either rapid fading (not expected for off-axis
jet emission), significant variability (not expected from scintillation
given the small source distance and hence large angular size), or a
spurious detection in the previously reported observations.   Further
observations are underway.

During its normal survey mode, the ATLAS survey project (Tonry et al.
2011, Stalder et al. 2017) frequently observed the field containing
galaxy NGC4993 during the period between 57380.64463 and 57966.26370
(602 to 16 days before G298048; the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and
the Virgo Collaboration GCN 21509) and the first discoveries and
detections of the optical/NIR transient SSSa17a/DLT17ck (Coulter et
al. GCN 21529, Allam et al. GCN 21530,Valenti et al. GCN21531,
Melandri et al. 21532).

We have completed a search for variability or eruptions at the
position of the optical transient in the 414 images over this period.
These images were taken typically with 4-5 images per night (30 second
exposures).

ATLAS observes in two wide-band filters, called "cyan" or "c:, which
roughly covers the SDSS/Pan-STARRS g and r filters, and â€œorangeâ€ or
"o", which roughly covers the SDSS/Pan-STARRS r and i. The position
was observed 414 times in one or other filter and on each of these we
forced flux measurements at the astrometric position of the transient
on the difference image. We used the Pan-STARRS images for the
astrometric postion of SSS17a/DLT17ck (Chambers et al. GCN 21553)

We measured 5-sigma flux limits and any epochs with greater than
5-sigma detections. The 5-sigma flux limits were in the range 18.5 +/-
0.4 (AB mag, median and standard deviation) and (19.4 +/- 0.4). We
found 44 images which formally had flux detections greater than
5-sigma, but on visual inspection we rule out these being real flux
variability at the transient position. They all appear to be residuals
from the host galaxy subtraction. With ATLAS, we rule out any
variability down to 18.5 to 19.4 (filter dependent) during a period
601 to 16 days before discovery of the optical transient. The last
image was on 57966.26370 (2017-08-01 06:19) with a 5-sigma limit of 
o < 18.2.

We report on observations obtained with the 1.54-m Danish Telescope located
at La Silla, Chile, of the GW counterpart SSS17a/DLT17ck (Coulter et al.,
LVC GCN 21529). Observations were obtained on 2017, August 19th, 21st and
22nd in the I-band (all three dates), and z-band (19th only). A summary of
the observations follows:

22-August    23:23:57.3    40 x 100        I

Image subtraction of the co-added I-band images obtained during the first
two nights reveals a residual transient at the following position:

RA, Dec (J2000): 13:09:48.11 -23:22:53.0

With an estimated uncertainty of ~0.5''. This position is consistent with
that found by other groups within its uncertainty radius.

Further analysis of the images is currently underway, including the precise
photometric calibration of the optical transient.â€‹

The Desert Fireball Network (DFN) is a network of 50 remote cameras located in the Western and South Australian desert designed for the detection and triangulation of Fireballs and bright meteors. The DFN cameras consist of a Nikon D800E camera equipped with a Samyang 8mm f/3.5 UMC Fish-eye CS II lens. The cameras capture full sky images with a cadence of 30s from sunset to sunrise every night of the year.

We retrieved images from a camera located at Wooleen Station (27.0872 deg S, 116.1611 deg E).  We analysed the images from the 17th of August from 12:39:28-12:49:28 UT: 2 minutes before the GW trigger to 7 minutes after. At this time the host galaxy NGC 4993 was at 20 degrees elevation, reducing the image sensitivity from 6th to 4th magnitude. The images show no persistent or transient sources in a 3 degree radius of NGC 4993, to a limiting visual magnitude of +4.

We have completed the PSF photometry of the observations of GW170817 carried out at the T80S telescope and the EABA telescope on 08/18/2017 and 08/19/2017 (GCN 21619, GCN, 21620). We calibrated our measurements using the Pan-STARRS1 catalog available at STScI, using their reported PSF magnitudes and uncertainties. The mid-point of our observations was 1.467d after the GW trigger - LIGO/Virgo G298048- (Julian Date of 2457984.495). At that time, we measured magnitudes of g=18.60, r=17.99, i=17.80 with uncertainties of +-0.02 mag.
Additionally with our observations utilizing the EABA telescope we obtained  r=18.78+-0.03 at 2.456d after the GW trigger -LIGO/Virgo G298048-.

We have further analysed the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations of
the field containing NGC 4993 and SSS17a/DLT17ck (Deller et al., LVC GCN
21588; Deller et al., LVC GCN 21850), producing images centered on the
sub-mJy radio source at the centre of NGC 4993 (Alexander et al., LVC GCN
21545;  Alexander et al., LVC GCN 21548; Bannister et al., LVC GCN 21559;
Alexander et al., LVC GCN 21589; Corsi et al., LVC GCN 21614).

The source is detected with a flux density of 0.22 mJy (9 sigma
significance, flux calibration scale uncertainty estimated at 20%).  The
data is consistent with either an unresolved or marginally resolved source,
while comparison with the flux densities estimated by the ATCA and VLA
observations indicate that most (or possibly all) of the source flux is
contained within this milliarcsecond-scale component. Taking the synthesized
beam size of 2.5 x 1.0 mas as an upper limit to the source size, the
inferred lower limit for the brightness temperature is 1.6 x 10^6 K,
consistent with an AGN interpretation.  The position obtained is
13:09:47.69398 -23:23:02.3195 (J2000), with estimated uncertainties
(dominated by systematics) of <=1 mas in each coordinate.

We report on Fast Radio Burst (FRB) search observations of GW counterpart
SSS17a/DLTck (eg. Coulter et al., LVC GCN 21529) with the Parkes 64m Radio
Telescope in FRB search mode.

Two 1-hour observations were searched for FRBs with Dispersion Measures
(DMs) ranging from 0 to 2000 pc/cc 2.5 days after the GW event.  The start
UT of the 1hr integrations was 2017-08-20 01:44:32 and 2017-08-20 02:50:14.
No FRBs were detected with a flux limit of 1.4 Jy (w/64 us)^{-1/2} where w
is the width of the FRB in microseconds.  An FRB in the host galaxy might be
expected to have a DM of ~55 pc/cc plus the unknown contribution from any
remnant.  FRBs of luminosity similar to those observed from the repeating
FRB 121102 would be detected at the distance of NGC 4993 with very high
significance (SNR>>100).

instrument mounted on the Las Cumbres Observatory Faulkes Telescope South
at the Siding Spring Observatory in Australia. We detect the continuum of
the transient at low signal-to-noise level.

We also observed SSS17a/DLT17ck on 2017-08-20 01:01:54, +2.51 days after
the LIGO/Virgo trigger, with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) on
the Gemini-South 8-m telescope. We observed in our red setting for 763
seconds and 128 seconds in our blue setting until the telescope reached its
altitude limit. We again detect the continuum at low signal to noise level
due to the high airmass at which the observations were made and the limited
exposure times due to observing constraints.

Following the VLA detection of a radio source (Mooley et al., LVC GCN

transient SSS17a/DLT17ck (Coulter et al. LVC GCN 21529; Allam et al., 
LVC GCN 21530; Yang et al., LVC GCN 21531), the possible counterpart of 
G298048 (LVC, LVC GCN 21505) in NGC 4993, we carried out observations of 
the field with the Sardinia Radio Telescope at 7.2 GHz (central 
frequency, with a bandwidth of 680 MHz). Observations were conducted on 
the days 2017-09-07, 2017-09-08, 2017-09-09, and 2017-09-19, for a total 
of approximately 18 hours of on-the-fly mapping over the entire 
region and about 8 minutes of on-source time. The target was observed at 
low elevations (<27 degrees) and the weather conditions were suboptimal 
for a large fraction of the observing time.

Data were taken to image a field of 0.3x0.3 deg^2 centred on the position
of the source that was reported to be detected with the VLA on 2017-09-03.
Calibration and analysis were conducted following two different
approaches:

- according to the procedures described in Egron et al. (2017,MNRAS, 470, 1329), we did
not detect any source and find an upper limit for a steady source at the
position of the target of 1.5 mJy (1 sigma) and a global rms of the image
of 0.9 mJy/beam (1 sigma);

- by using the map-making software described in Carretti et al. (2010, MNRAS, 405, 1670), 
 we did not detect any source at that position, at an upper limit of
0.5 mJy rms (1 sigma) as computed for a steady source.

According to the condition of each single observation, we find an upper
limit ranging between at most 1 and 3 mJy for each observing session. At
present a refinement of the analysis is ongoing and observations at
subsequent epochs and at higher frequencies are planned.

The 100-m Effelsberg telescope of the MPIfR  observed the location of SSS17a 
(Coulter et al. 2017, LVC GCN 21529) using the position provided by Adams et al.
(LVC GCN 21816). Observations were conducted at 5, 15 and 32 GHz; none of them
detected a counterpart.

Observations at 32 GHz were performed at 10/9/2017 at UT 13:35 with the 100m telescope under moderate weather 
conditions using its secondary focus 9mm multi-beam receiver. In total, six maps were performed
on the position of SSS17a. Data analysis was done with the MPIfRâ€™s software packages 
â€žToolboxâ€œ and â€žNod3â€œ (see MÃ¼ller et al., 2017). First, some weather effects were removed by 
subtracting the maps of one of the â€žOffâ€œ-Horns from the â€žOnâ€œ-Horn. After some additional
baseline adjustment, the data was averaged and calibrated in Jy. Calibration parameters 
were determined by a similar observation of 3C286. The rms of the final map was 30 mJy 
(due to imperfect weather conditions and low elevation). Efforts are ongoing to
improve those limits.

Observations at C-band were also conducted at 10/9/2017 13:10 UT.  No source was detected and limits do not
improve on previous reports (e.g. Paragi et al., LVC CGN 21763; Alexander et al., LVC CGN 21851).

At a central frequency of 14.6 GHz, we used a cryogenically cooled
receiver (summed polarisations for 128 spectral channels, across a
bandwidth of 500 MHz, and with a data sampling interval of âˆ¼ 65 us) on
15/9/2017 (MJD 58011.537210648) for approximately 4025 seconds. Data
have been dedispersed in the range 0 to 50 000 pc cmâˆ’3 and analysed
for periodic signals and transient burst like events (e.g. FRBs) using
single pulse search tools in the presto software package
(http://www.cv.nrao.edu/ sransom/presto/).

For a 10-sigma detection threshold, we achieve the following limits to
periodic signals: 76 uJy and 52 uJy for duty cycles of 10% and 5%,
respectively. Note that at this frequency, weather effects can
decrease the sensitivity by at least a factor of two. More accurate
flux calibration using a noise diode and reference source is on-going.

At this observing frequency our transient search has revealed signals
that cannot yet be easily distinguished from terrrestrial radio
interference. Sensitivity limits for transients depend upon the
unknown intrinsic pulse width and pulse broadening factors, however
for a single pulse of width 1,3,5 and 10 ms, and DM of 1000 pc cmâˆ’3
(smearing at the central frequecny channel = 10.414 us), we find
6-sigma flux density limits of 0.32, 0.19, 0.15 and 0.10 Jy
respectively.

We observed 2017-08-18 07:07 UT to 2017-08-18 09:35 UT at a central frequency of 185 MHz and with a bandwidth of 30 MHz.  No emission was detected at the position of NGC 4993.  The RMS noise was 17 mJy/beam (note that the array is in the process of being reconfigured, so only 5/16 of the tiles are operational).   Analysis of subsequent epochs with the reconfigured array is underway.

Pi of the Sky robotic wide field of view telescopes search for the
possible EM transients in the sky scans performed twice a night. Each
of the two observation sites (South telescope in Chile and the North
one in Spain) can cover up to about 20000 sq. deg. with range up to
about 12.5m. Dedicated algorithms search for brightness changes of
objects listed in GLADE to detect optical transients that might be
connected with those galaxies.

In the analysis related to G29048 we considered data collected by Pi
of the Sky North telescope located in Spain, near Huelva, between
August 17 and August 21, while the earlier data collected between
August 10 and August 16 were used as a reference. The observations
were performed in wide visible band, with IR-cut and UV-cut filters
only, to achieve deepest detection limit. For each scan field 10
images with 10s exposure were taken and stacked for the analysis. On
the night of 20170817 we surveyed area that overlaped partially with 
the initial bayesstar skymap for G298048. Unfortunatly, the dedicated 
scan procedure was interupted twice that night by the GCN alerts, 
resulting in the event coverage reduced to only about 29% probability, 
even after including other data collected that night. Coverage of 
about 51% was expected for uninterupted scan procedure, as 
obtained on the following nights. Data was searched for any type of 
transients connected with objects from GLADE catalogue. No 
significant transient candidate remained after all selection cuts.

Test Centre in Mazagón near Huelva, Spain.

We report continued radio monitoring of LIGO/VIRGO G298048 with the Karl G.
Jansky Very Large Array (PI: Alexander, Program 17A-231). Our most recent
observations started on 2017 September 25.703 UT, or 39.2 days post-trigger
(LVC et al., GCN 21509), at a mean frequency of 6 GHz. We clearly detect
the radio counterpart (Hallinan et al., GCN 21929) at ~5-sigma significance
at a brightness comparable to the limit of our previous VLA observations.
Further observations are planned.

We thank the VLA staff for their assistance in scheduling and executing

As previously reported (GCN 21680, GCN 21848), the Long Wavelength
Array (LWA1, located west of Socorro, New Mexico) followed up on
G298048 on 17 August and 24 August, observing with 4 beams: one
centered on NGC 4993, one including it off-center, and two nearby that
exclude the source.

After including observations from an additional epoch (30 August at
19:50 UTC, two weeks after the GW event), and further analysis, we
have concluded that the detection reported earlier (GCN 21848) is not
statistically significant. We now set 3-sigma upper limits to the
appearance of a radio source in an LWA1 beam centered on NGC 4993,
about 8 hours after the GW event, as ~200 Jy at 25 MHz and ~100 Jy
at 45 MHz.

A publication describing these limits and our analysis is in
preparation.

On 2017 Sept 29.86 UT, the Spitzer space telescope took deep mid-infrared
observations at the position of SSS17a (Coulter et al. LVC GCN 21529) with
Channel 1 (3.6 microns) and Channel 2 (4.5 microns) of the  Infrared Array

We conducted a preliminary analysis of the IRAC Basic Calibrated Data

subtraction to remove the extended emission from the host galaxy NGC 4993.
We find possible, marginal evidence for excess emission at the position of
SSS17a at 4.5um. We are continuing monitoring with Spitzer/IRAC.

The Chandra X-ray Observatory re-observed the field of GW170817/AT2017gfo
(PI: B. Wilkes) starting on 2017-12-03 (~109 days after the LVC trigger)
for a total exposure of 74 ks. A second shorter observation was performed on
2017-12-06 for a total exposure of 25 ks.

Our preliminary analysis of the data clearly detects the X-ray counterpart
of AT2017gfo at a flux level of ~1.5E-14 erg/cm^2/s (0.5-8.0 keV).
The observed value is three times higher than the flux measured at
earlier times (~5E-15 erg/cm^2/s at 15 days; Troja, E., et al. 2017,
Nature, 551, 71) and implies a continued rise of the X-ray afterglow.
We do not measure any significant spectral variation between these
observations and our observations at earlier times.

This behavior is hard to reconcile with the simple top-hat jet model and
suggests a more complex structure of the GRB jet.


We thank Belinda Wilkes, Andrea Prestwich and the entire Chandra for

R. Margutti, W. Fong (Northwestern), T. Eftekhari, K. Alexander, E. Berger
(Harvard), R. Chornock (Ohio University) report:


¿The Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO) started observing GW170817 on 2017
December 3 at 01:38:45UT for a total of 74.09 ksec (obs ID 20860, PI
Wilkes). At the position of the electromagnetic counterpart, an X-ray
source is clearly detected with a significance of ~33-sigma (RA =
13:09:48.090, Dec = -23:22:52.87, J2000), with a net count-rate of 1.47e-3
cps (0.5-8 keV).

The CXO observed the field for an additional 24.74 ksec starting on 2017
December 6 at 10:43:31UT (obs ID 20861, PI Wilkes). The X-ray source is
still detected with a significance of ~15-sigma with a net count-rate of
1.41e-3 cps (0.5-8 keV).

The joint spectrum can be fit with an absorbed power-law spectral model
with photon index Gamma= 1.50 +\-0.16 (1 sigma c.l.). We find no evidence
for intrinsic neutral hydrogen absorption in addition to the Galactic value
(NH_MW=0.0784e22 cm-2, Kalberla et al., 2005) and place a 3 sigma upper
limit of NHint<0.7e22 cm-2. These properties are consistent with the X-ray
spectral properties of GW170817 at t<15 days inferred by Margutti et al.,
2017 and Troja et al., 2017.

Based on our best fitting spectral parameters, the 0.3-10 keV unabsorbed
flux is

2.3e-14 erg/s/cm^2, indicating a substantial brightening of the X-ray
source during the last ~90 days, in agreement with the results from Troja
et al., GCN 22201. A comparison with radio observations acquired 93 days
since merger (Mooley et al., 2017)  indicates a spectral slope beta~-0.6 of
the Fnu ~nu^-beta spectrum, similar to the radio-to-Xray spectrum of
GW170817 before Sun block (Alexander et al., 2017; Margutti et al., 2017;
Troja et al., 2017; Haggard et al., 2017; Hallinan et al., 2017; Mooley et
al., 2017). This result suggests negligible spectral evolution of GW170817
in the last 90 days, and that the radio and X-ray emission continue to
represent the same emission component.

Based on this spectrum, we expect GW170817 to be detectable at optical-NIR
wavelengths at approximately 26.5 AB magnitude.

We thank Belinda Wilkes and the entire CXO team for approving these DDT
requests and making these observations possible.¿

Daryl Haggard, John J. Ruan, Melania Nynka (McGill/MSI), Vicky Kalogera (Northwestern/CIERA), and Phil Evans (Leicester) report:

We have performed a detailed analysis of new Chandra X-ray observations of GW170817 obtained via Chandra Director's Discretionary Time (PI: Wilkes, Program Number 18408601). The X-ray counterpart to GW170817/GRB170817A/SSS17a is clearly detected in the new observations.

This program acquired two exposures of GRB170817A: (1) a 74.09 ks exposure (ObsID 20860) beginning at 2017 December 2.08 UT, approximately 108 days post-burst, and (2) a 24.74 ks exposure (ObsID 20861) beginning at 2017 December 6.45 UT, approximately 111 days post-burst. Since the two new exposures are close in time and the X-ray emission of GRB170817A is not expected to vary significantly over ~4 day timescales, we co-add the two data sets into one 98.83 ks exposure at 109.2 days post-burst.

We perform spectral extractions assuming an absorbed power-law spectral model with fixed NH = 7.5e20 cm^âˆ’2 and find that the X-ray flux of GRB170817A has an absorbed flux of f(0.3âˆ’8 keV) = 1.58eâˆ’14 +/- 0.14 erg s^âˆ’1 cm^âˆ’2  (Gamma = 1.62 +/- 0.27) at 109.2 days post-burst, which corresponds to an unabsorbed luminosity of L(0.3âˆ’10 keV) = 42.5e38 +/- 3.7 erg s^âˆ’1 (see also Troja et al. GCN 22201 and Margutti et al. GCN 22203). This represents significant X-ray brightening compared to Chandra observations at 15.6 days post-burst, for which we find an absorbed flux of f(0.3âˆ’8 keV) = 0.36eâˆ’14 +/- 0.1 erg s^âˆ’1 cm^âˆ’2 (Gamma = 2.4 +/- 0.8) and an unabsorbed luminosity of L(0.3âˆ’10 keV) = 10.4e38 +/- 2.0 erg s^âˆ’1 (Haggard et al. 2017).

We also examine the three previously-detected X-ray sources CXOU J130948, CXOU 130946, and the host galaxy NGC 4993. The fluxes of CXOU 130946 and the host-galaxy NGC 4993 are consistent with our previous deep Chandra observations, while CXOU J130948 appears to be variable in X-rays (Margutti et al. 2017; Haggard et al. 2017).

The origin of the X-ray emission from the NS-NS coalescence GW170817/GRB170817A is an important diagnostic for all post-merger interpretations, and different scenarios predict distinct evolution in its X-ray light curve. These observations support scenarios in which the X-ray and radio emission share a common origin, i.e., the X-ray light curve is consistent with outflow models which may be either a cocoon shocked by the jet or dynamical ejecta from the merger. Further deep X-ray monitoring can place powerful constraints on the physical parameters of these models. The X-ray brightening strengthens the argument that simple top-hat jet models are not consistent with the latest observations. However, more advanced models of structured jets with off-axis viewing angles should be pursued and cannot yet be ruled out.

We thank Belinda Wilkes and the Chandra scheduling, data processing, and archive teams for making these observations possible.

"We obtained further observations of the counterpart of GW170817 with the Hubble Space Telescope. Observations took place on 6 Dec 2017 and utilised both optical (F606W, F814W) and infrared (F140W,F160W) filters. 

At the location of the transient we recover the source in both optical filters, but do not detect it in the infrared, where the background from the galaxy is higher. The measured magnitudes of the source in the optical bands are broadly consistent with the extrapolation from the 93 day radio epoch (Mooley et al. 2017 arXiv 1711.11573) to the near contemporaneous observations with Chandra (Troja et al. 2017 GCN 22201, Margutti et al. 2017 GCN 22202).

K. P. Mooley (Oxford, NRAO/Caltech) et al. report

The X-ray flux of GW170817 on December 03-06 (reported by Troja et al. 
2017, GCN 22201; Margutti et al. 2017, GCN 22203, Haggard et al. 2017, 
GCN 22206 based on the Chandra observations) is exactly as predicted 
last week by Mooley et al. 2017 (http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11573) based 
on radio spectral indices.

This suggests that the radio and X-ray emission both arise from a mildly 
relativistic wide-angle outflow, consistent with the cocoon model (see 
also Gottlieb et al. 2017, Hallinan et al. 2017, Kasliwal et al. 2017). 
A relativistic jet core, if it exists, is either too weak (having a 
sub-dominant contribution to the radio light curve early on) or too 
strong (such that its electromagnetic signatures will be observed in the 
future). See Mooley et al. 2017 for details.

Daryl Haggard, Melania Nynka, John J. Ruan (McGill/MSI), Phil Evans 
(Leicester), and Vicky Kalogera (Northwestern/CIERA) report:

We have obtained new X-ray observations of GW170817 via Chandra 
Director's Discretionary Time (PI: Wilkes, Program Number 19408607). The 
X-ray counterpart to GW170817/GRB170817A/SSS17a continues to be detected 
and the X-ray emission continues to brighten approximately 156 days 
after the neutron star merger. This contradicts previous claims of the 
X-ray fading of GW170817 in XMM-Newton observations at 135 days 
(D'Avanzo et al. 2018, arXiv: 1801.06164).

This new Chandra program acquired several exposures of GRB170817A:

ObsID,  ExpTime,  StartDate,           Days Post-Burst
-----   -------   ---------            ---------------
20936   31.75 ks  2018-01-17 21:55:17  153.5 days
20938   15.86 ks  2018-01-21 13:45:18  157.1 days
20939   22.25 ks  2018-01-24 08:18:48  159.9 days

Since these new Chandra exposures are close in time and the X-ray 
emission of GRB170817A is not expected to vary significantly over <10 
day timescales, we co-add these three data sets into one 69.86 ks 
exposure at 156.4 days post-burst.

We perform spectral extractions assuming an absorbed power-law spectral 
model with fixed NH = 7.5e20 cm^¿2 and find that the X-ray flux of 
GRB170817A has an absorbed flux of f(0.3¿8 keV) = 1.93(+0.39/-0.32)e¿14 
erg s^¿1 cm^¿2  (with Gamma ~ 1.67) at 156.4 days post-burst, which 
corresponds to an unabsorbed luminosity of L(0.3¿10 keV) = 
5.23(+1.30/-0.95)e39 erg s^¿1 (assuming a luminosity distance of 42.5 Mpc).

This represents continued X-ray brightening compared to Chandra 
observations at 15.6 and 109.2 days post-burst, for which we find an 
absorbed flux of f(0.3¿8 keV) = 0.36(+0.1/-0.07)e¿14 erg s^¿1 cm^¿2 
(with Gamma = 2.4 +/- 0.8, unabsorbed L(0.3¿10 keV) = 10.4(+2.0/-1.6)e38 
erg s^¿1; Haggard et al. 2017) and f(0.3¿8 keV) = 1.58(+0.14/-0.13)e¿14 
erg s^¿1 cm^¿2 (with Gamma = 1.6 +/- 0.3, unabsorbed L(0.3¿10 keV) = 
42.5(+3.7/-3.5)e38 erg s^¿1; Ruan et al. 2018), respectively.

Our findings here contradict recent reports of dimming in the X-ray flux 
from XMM Newton at 135 days (D'Avanzo et al. 2018), which was reported 
to be 2.1(+0.7/-0.5)e-15 erg s^¿1 cm^¿2 (0.3-10 keV unabsorbed). 
However, this reported flux value is a typo, and should be 
2.1(+0.7/-0.5)e-14 erg s^¿1 cm^¿2 (D¿Avanzo 2018, private 
communication). Taking this corrected flux and rescaling to a 0.3-8 keV 
absorbed flux for comparison to the previous Chandra measurements above 
gives 1.67(+0.87/-0.64)e-14 erg s^¿1 cm^¿2. Thus, the recent X-ray data 
at 15.6 days (Chandra), 109.2 days (Chandra), 135 days (XMM), and 156.4 
days (Chandra) are all consistent with continued X-ray brightening. We 
provide a light curve table summarizing these measurements:

Days,  Telescope,  Flux* (0.3-8 abs),     Ref

*Flux units: erg s^¿1 cm^¿2; all uncertainties are 90% confidence interval

Current post-merger models suggest that the origin of the X-rays could 
be afterglow emission from either a mildly-relativistic cocoon or a 
structured jet. For a cocoon, the continued rise of X-ray emission 
suggest that the cocoon has not yet reached a deceleration phase. For a 
structured jet, the rising X-ray emission suggest emission from the jet 
core has not yet entered the observed line of sight. Continued 
monitoring of GW170817 will be critical for discriminating between these 
and other models.

Note that another ~30 ks of Chandra observations during this same time 
interval are forthcoming.

We thank Belinda Wilkes and the Chandra scheduling, data processing, and 
archive teams for making these observations possible.

FROM:    Eleonora Troja at GSFC  <eleonora.troja@nasa.gov>

E. Troja (UMD/GSFC) and L. Piro (INAF/IAPS) report on behalf of
a larger collaboration:

The Chandra X-ray Observatory re-observed the field of GW170817
starting on January 17th, 2018, and performed five short exposures
observations as part of its on-going monitoring program (PI: Wilkes).

Only three of these exposures (ObsID: 20936, 20938, 20939) are currently
archived and available to the public. Here we report the preliminary
findings
from these observations.

The X-ray afterglow is detected with high significance in all the exposures
at an average count rate of 0.0016 cts/s in the 0.5-8.0 keV energy band.
A preliminary inspection of the hardness ratio does not show any
significant
spectral variation. Therefore, we perform a spectral analysis using an
absorbed
power-law model with absorption column fixed at the Galactic value of
7.5E20 cm^-2 and a photon index Gamma=1.575 as derived from our broadband
analysis (Troja et al. 2018, arXiv:1801.06516).

We derive an unabsorbed X-ray flux of (3.2 +/- 0.3)E-14 erg/cm2/s in the
0.3-10 keV energy band. The quoted error is at the 68% confidence level.
This new measurement is higher than the value measured by Chandra
at ~110 days (~2.5E-14 erg/cm2/s, Troja et al. 2018), and higher than the
value measured by XMM-Newton at ~135 days (D'Avanzo et al., 2018).

The latest measurement is consistent with a rising afterglow with F~t^0.8,
although, within the errors, a slow turn-over of the X-ray light curve
cannot be excluded.

Further analysis is on-going.

FROM:    Eleonora Troja at GSFC  <eleonora.troja@nasa.gov>

E. Troja (UMD/GSFC) and L. Piro (INAF/IAPS) report on behalf of
a larger collaboration:

We analyzed the full set of five observations of GW170817
performed by the Chandra X-ray Observatory between January 17th
and January 28th, 2018, i.e. ~153 and ~164 days after the merger.
A log of observations is reported below:

ObsID   Exposure [ks]     0.5-8.0 keV count rate [cts/s]

20936     31.75           0.0018 +/- 0.0002
20937     20.77           0.0014 +/- 0.0003
20938     15.86           0.0019 +/- 0.0003
20939     22.25           0.0011 +/- 0.0002
20945     14.22           0.0010 +/- 0.0003

The average net count-rate is 0.00148 +/- 0.00011 cts/s,
consistent with the value of 0.00145 +/- 0.00014 observed
at 110 days (Troja et al. 2018, arXiv:1801.06516).
The average spectrum, obtained by coadding the five exposures,
is well described by an absorbed power-law model with
N_H=7.5E20 cm^-2 and photon index Gamma=1.65+/-0.16 (68% c.l.),
consistent with the value derived from the broadband spectrum
at earlier times (Troja et al. 2018, arXiv:1801.06516).
Based on this new analysis, we estimate an unabsorbed X-ray flux
of (2.6 +/- 0.3)E-14 erg/cm2/s (68% c.l.) in the 0.3-10 keV band,
consistent with the X-ray flux measured at 110 days.

Our results do not support the claim of a decreasing X-ray flux,
as suggested by D'Avanzo et al. (2018, arXiv:1801.06164), and
are consistent either with a slowly rising afterglow or a slow
turn-over of the X-ray light curve expected when the afterglow
reaches its peak (e.g. Lazzati et al. 2017, arXiv:1712.03237;
Troja et al. 2018, arXiv:1801.06516).

We note that the X-ray afterglow displays a marginal level of
variability on timescales of a few days, being the count-rate
from the last two exposures (20939,20945) consistently lower.
The spectrum from these two observations is characterized by a
photon index Gamma= 1.9 +/- 0.3 (68% c. l.), slightly softer
than the value measured in the first three exposures (20936,20937,
and 20938) Gamma = 1.59+/-0.17  (68% c. l.), yet consistent within
the large uncertainties. The lower count-rate and soft spectral
shape could be indicative of the cooling frequency entering the
X-ray band, although the limited statistics prevent us to draw
any firm conclusion.

(Harvard/CfA) report

"The Chandra X-ray Observatory started another round of follow-up
observations of GW170817. The first observation (ID 21080) was taken on May
03, 2018 at 10:41:26 UT (t ~ 259 d after merger) for a total exposure time
of 50.8 ks (PI Wilkes; program 19408644).   We find that an X-ray source is
detected at the location of GW170817 with a count-rate of (7.7 +/- 1.3)e-4
cts/s (0.5 - 8 keV) and 13.8-sigma significance. We modeled the spectrum
with an absorbed simple power-law and find a best-fitting photon index,
 Gamma = 1.4 +/- 0.3 and no evidence for intrinsic absorption. The galactic
neutral hydrogen column density in the direction of the transient is, N_H =
7.8E+20cm-2 (Kalberla et al., 2005). For these parameters, the unabsorbed
flux is (1.3 +/- 0.3)e-14 ergs cm-2 s-1 (0.3 - 10 keV).

A second observation (ID 21090) was acquired on May 05, 2018 at 01:25:30 UT
(~ 261 days after merger) for a total exposure time of 46.0 ks. GW170817 is
detected with 14.8-sigma significance and a count-rate of (8.3 +/-  1.4)e-4
cts/s (0.5 - 8 keV). The best-fitting photon-index is Gamma = 1.3 +/- 0.3.
The corresponding unabsorbed flux is (1.5 +0.5/-0.3) e-14 ergs cm-2 s-1
(0.3 - 10 keV).

The best fitting photon index from a joint spectral fit is Gamma = 1.43 +/-
0.15, consistent with the photon index measured at ~160 days. We conclude
that there is no evidence for the passage of the synchrotron cooling
frequency through the Chandra band.

The total 0.5-8 keV count-rate inferred from the two observations is
(8.0+/-0.9)e-4 cts/s.  The X-ray source shows significant fading compared
to the previous epoch at ~160 days (inferred rate of (1.50 +\-0.12)e-3
cts/s, Margutti et al., 2018). Applying a simple binomial test, we find
that the detected fading is significant at a level > 4 sigma. We can thus
reject the hypothesis of a random fluctuation of the X-ray count-rate, and
conclude that these Chandra observations provide the first statistically
significant evidence for a decaying X-ray emission from GW170817.

We thank the entire Chandra team for making these observations possible."

E. Troja (UMD/GSFC), L. Piro (IAPS/INAF), G. Ryan (UMD) report on
behalf of a larger collaboration:


The Chandra X-ray Observatory re-observed the field of GW170817
starting on May 3rd, 2018 as part of its on-going monitoring
program (PI: Wilkes). Observations were split into two exposures
of 50.7 ks and 46 ks, respectively.

The X-ray afterglow is significantly detected at an average level
of (8.5 +/- 1.4)E-04 cts/s, well below the value (14.8 +/- 1.1)E-04 cts/s
measured  at ~160 d after the merger (Troja & Piro, GCN Circ. 22374;
Troja et al. 2018). The spectrum is well described by an absorbed
power-law model with photon index 1.5 +/- 0.2, consistent with the
value of 1.575 derived at earlier times from the broadband spectrum.
By using this value we derive an unabsorbed X-ray flux of
(1.4 +/- 0.2)E-14 erg/cm2/s at 260 days after the merger.

A comparison with the afterglow models derived in Troja et al. (2018)
is shown at this link:
https://www.astro.umd.edu/~gsryan/GW170817/xray.png

This new X-ray observation supports earlier claims (D'Avanzo et al. 2018;
Dobie et al. 2018) that the afterglow entered its post-peak decay phase.
However, no clear distinction between the competing models is possible.
Further observations are critical to probe the structure of the
relativistic outflow.

We observed the optical counterpart of GRB 170817A (Kienlin et al., GCN
21520) associated to GW 170817 (LVC GCN Circ. 21509, 21513) with the LBC
imager mounted on the Large Binocular Telescope (Mt Graham, AZ, USA).
Observations were performed in the r-sloan filter on 2018-01-23, i.e.,
~160 days after the GW/GRB trigger.

At the location of the optical transient (e.g., Coulter et al., GCN
21529; Adams et al., 21816) we detect the optical afterglow of GRB
170817A with magnitude r-sloan=26.2+-0.4, calibrated against Pan-STARRS
field stars. Image analysis was performed after preliminary removal of
an elliptical model of the underlying host galaxy from each single
frame. However, some residual emission is left which contributes for
~0.2 mags to the uncertainty of the photometry.

Our detection is the first one from a ground-based optical telescope. It
is in agreement with a turnover/flattening in the optical light curve of
GW 170817/GRB 170817A as inferred by Alexander at al. 2018
(arXiv:1805.02870) and with the overall flattening/declining temporal
evolution observed in the X-ray and radio bands (D'Avanzo et al. 2018,

The Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO) started observing GW170817 on 2017
December 3 at 01:38:45UT for a total of 74.09 ksec (obs ID 20860, PI Wilkes).
At the position of the electromagnetic counterpart, an X-ray source is
clearly detected with a significance of ~33-sigma (RA = 13:09:48.090, Dec
= -23:22:52.87, J2000), with a net count-rate of 1.47e-3 cps (0.5-8 keV).

The CXO observed the field for an additional 24.74 ksec starting on 2017
December 6 at 10:43:31UT (obs ID 20861, PI Wilkes). The X-ray source is
still detected with a significance of ~15-sigma with a net count-rate of
1.41e-3 cps (0.5-8 keV).

The joint spectrum can be fit with an absorbed power-law spectral model
with photon index Gamma= 1.50 +\-0.16 (1 sigma c.l.). We find no evidence
for intrinsic neutral hydrogen absorption in addition to the Galactic value
(NH_MW=0.0784e22 cm-2, Kalberla et al., 2005) and place a 3 sigma upper
limit of NHint<0.7e22 cm-2. These properties are consistent with the X-ray
spectral properties of GW170817 at t<15 days inferred by Margutti et al.,
2017 and Troja et al., 2017.

Based on our best fitting spectral parameters, the 0.3-10 keV unabsorbed
flux is
2.3e-14 erg/s/cm^2, indicating a substantial brightening of the X-ray source
during the last ~90 days, in agreement with the results from Troja et al.,
GCN 22201. A comparison with radio observations acquired 93 days since
merger (Mooley et al., 2017)  indicates a spectral slope beta~-0.6 of the
Fnu ~nu^-beta spectrum, similar to the radio-to-Xray spectrum of GW170817
before Sun block (Alexander et al., 2017; Margutti et al., 2017; Troja
et al., 2017; Haggard et al., 2017; Hallinan et al., 2017; Mooley et al.,
2017). This result suggests negligible spectral evolution of GW170817 in
the last 90 days, and that the radio and X-ray emission continue to represent
the same emission component.

Based on this spectrum, we expect GW170817 to be detectable at optical-NIR
wavelengths at approximately 26.5 AB magnitude.

We thank Belinda Wilkes and the entire CXO team for approving these DDT
requests and making these observations possible.

Daryl Haggard, Melania Nynka, and J. J. Ruan (McGill/MSI) report:

We analyze new Chandra X-ray observations of neutron star merger 
GW170817 at 358.6 days post-merger, which now reveals fading at a t^-1.6 
rate.

Chandra obtained a 67.16 ks observation of GW170817 (ObsID: 21371, PI: 
Troja) on 10 August 2018, at 358.6 days post-merger. GW170817 is still 
clearly detected, and we measure a 0.5-8 keV count rate of 4.9 
(+0.9/-0.9) cts/s. We extract and fit the X-ray spectrum assuming an 
absorbed power-law spectral model, with fixed NH = 7.5e20 cm^-2. We 
measure an absorbed flux of f(0.3-8 keV) = 6.3 (+3.8/-2.1) x10^-15 
erg/s/cm^2 (90% c.l.) and photon index of Gamma = 1.6 (+1.3/-0.9), which 
corresponds to an unabsorbed luminosity of L(0.3-10 keV) = 1.7 
(+1.1/-0.5) x10^39 erg/s assuming a luminosity distance of 42.5 Mpc.

The previous Chandra observation at 260.0 days showed an absorbed flux 
of f(0.3-8 keV) = 1.09 (+0.24/-0.20) x10^-14 erg/s/cm^2 (Nynka et al. 
2018). A power-law fit of this previous 260.0 day flux to the new 358.6 
day flux reveals fading at a t^-1.6 rate. This is steeper than the 
t^-1.3 fading observed between 159.7 and 260.0 days post-merger, and 
thus the X-ray afterglow light curve is now fading more rapidly.

A. Corsi (TTU), D. Frail (NRAO), report on behalf of a larger collaboration
Our continued observations of GW170817 with the ATCA and the VLA up to 300
days post-merger (Mooley et al. in prep) confirm the t^(-2) decline in the
radio light curve initially reported in Mooley et al. 2018 (arXiv:1806.09693).
Such a slope rules out a cocoon-dominated outflow at late times, and is
instead the classic signature of a relativistic jet, consistent with the
VLBI result from Mooley et al. 2018. The t^(-2) decline is also expected in
the X-ray light curve, and may be confirmed by the Chandra observation carried
out on 2018 Aug 10.

GW170817 (another ~ 64ks will be acquired in the next few days). Chandra
started to observe GW170817 on 21 March 2019 at 07:44 UT (obsID 21322,
Co-PIs Margutti and Fong; program 20500299). X-ray emission from GW170817
is detected at the level of ~3 sigma  (assuming pure Poissonian
statistics), with a 0.5-8 keV count-rate of  (1.5 +\-0.7)e-4 c/s, and a
total of ~5 net photons. Assuming a simple power-law spectrum with photon
index Gamma=1.6 and no intrinsic absorption, as found in previous Chandra
observations (e.g., Margutti et al., 2018; Alexander et al., 2018), the
count-rate above translates into an unabsorbed flux of  (2.3+\- 1.1)e-15
erg/s/cm2 (0.3-10 keV). The Galactic neutral hydrogen column density in the
direction of the transient is N_H = 7.8e+20cm-2 (Kalberla et al., 2005).
This flux measurement is consistent with the expectations from the fast
decay of the emission from the jet (e.g., Margutti et al., 2018; Alexander
et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2018). Fur(her Chandra observations are ongoing.

We thank the entire Chandra team for making these observations possible."

¿We initiated a series of  Chandra X-ray observations of GW170817 at t~581
days since merger, for a total exposure time of 100 ks. The results from
the first observation with the exposure time of ~36 ks is reported in
Hajela et al. (GCN 23987).

Here, we report on the remaining ~64ks of Chandra observations of GW170817
acquired starting on 22 March 2019 at 06:17 UT (obsID 22157, exposure time
of ~38 ks) and 23 March 2019 at 23:52 UT (obsID 22158, exposure time of ~25
ks, PIs Margutti and Fong). X-ray emission from GW170817 is detected with a
significance of >=3 sigma in each of the observations, with a total of ~6
and ~3 photons from the source in obsID 22157 and obsID 22158, respectively
(0.5-8 keV energy range).

Assuming a simple power-law spectral model with photon index Gamma = 1.6
and NHint = 0, as found in previous Chandra observations (e.g., Margutti et
al., 2018; Alexander et al., 2018), we find an unabsorbed flux of (2.7 +\-
1.2)e-15 erg/s/cm2 and (6.3+\- 3.5)e-15 erg/s/cm2 for ObsID 22157 and
22158, respectively (0.3-10 keV). The Galactic neutral hydrogen column
density in the direction of the transient is NH = 7.8e+20cm-2 (Kalberla et
al., 2005).

From a joint spectral fit of the three epochs of data (obsID 21322, 22157,
and 22158) we find that the photon index is loosely constrained to
Gamma=1.6 +/- 0.8 and there is no evidence for intrinsic absorption.  For
Gamma=1.6, and NHint=0, the joint fit of the entire 100ks of Chandra
observations indicates an unabsorbed flux of (3.6 +/- 0.9)e-15 erg/s/cm2 (t~582
days since merger, 0.3-10 keV). We confirm that this flux measurement is
consistent with the expectations from the fast decay of the emission from
the jet (e.g., Margutti et al., 2018; Alexander et al., 2018; Wu et al.,
2018).  All fluxes reported are in the 0.3-10 keV energy range with 1-sigma
uncertainties.

We thank the entire Chandra team for making these observations possible.¿
